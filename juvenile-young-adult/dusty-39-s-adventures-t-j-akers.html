  <title>Dusty&#39;s Adventures - T.J. Akers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When KITTEN, a young, homeless black cat, is rescued by LIOSA the magical Moon Lady, his life changes immediately. The Moon Lady pairs him with DUSTY the gentle, yellow horse from the heroic line of SLEPNIR on a ranch far from his home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Kitten doesn&amp;rsquo;t adjust easily. Dusty proves to be bossy and imposes strict rules as to what Kitten can and can&amp;rsquo;t do. The friction intensifies as JANGLES the burro, a resident of the ranch and secret agent of MAGUS, Liosa&amp;rsquo;s arch-enemy, sets traps for Kitten that the cat barely evades. Kitten tries to warn Dusty, but the loyal horse refuses to believe Jangles is a traitor until the night Kitten and Dusty come upon Jangles and Magus conspiring together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magus tells the pair that he had a deal with Jangles, but has found a new way to accomplish his goals. He murders the burro, much to Dusty&amp;rsquo;s horror and Kitten&amp;rsquo;s surprising sadness. Dusty sets to attack Magus, but the villain disappears and a new kind of minion is loosed. Dusty pursues it as Kitten stays with the burro. The next day MARK, Dusty&amp;rsquo;s owner, and the neighbor girl, KENZIE, come upon the burro and a sad kitten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The moonstone that protects the ranch was destroyed by Jangles betrayal, which means Dusty and his sister DAISY must return to their original home, leaving Kitten without protection. Magus sends Mark a package that turns him into a camel to keep Mark from helping.&amp;nbsp; Kenzie faints at the sight, but awakens to find the horses and Kitten standing in the house in front of her. Dusty breaks his rule and reveals their secret. They can talk and understand humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dusty enlists the aid of Kenzie to drive Mark&amp;rsquo;s truck and horse trailer to the mountains. Dusty forbids Kitten from coming because it&amp;rsquo;s not safe. Kitten disobeys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the mountains, the party comes upon two young Big Foot children hunted by Magus&amp;rsquo;s minions. Dusty swings into action to protect the kids and dispatches them. A swarm of Big Foot children come from out of nowhere joyful at the big horse&amp;rsquo;s appearance. When they arrive at the Big Foot village, Kitten and Kenzie take a moment to explore. They meet GRIMALKIN, a friend of Liosa&amp;rsquo;s. He takes them to the center of the village where there are murals setup that explain the fight between the Moon Lady and Magus, and how Magus has turned mad at the thought of passing on, even after all this time. Grimalkin also explains that the Big Foot village has lived under the domination of Magus for a long time. The children believe that will change now that Dusty is there. The final mural shows the image of a black cat sitting on a dead, yellow horse that looks like Dusty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Kenzie and Kitten return, Dusty and Daisy are gone with all the Big Foot children, except for LIL&amp;rsquo; FUZZY. He explains that the children told Dusty if he would surrender himself to the Magus, the Big Foot would be free of the Magus interference forever. Dusty agreed but didn&amp;rsquo;t want anyone to tell Kitten or Kenzie. Kitten and Kenzie set out to help Dusty, and Fuzzy takes them to his grandfather&amp;rsquo;s workshop to help them find weapons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the workshop, Kitten and Kenzie learn how to fight the wentzels using &amp;ldquo;soft light&amp;rdquo;. A final showdown ensues and Magus is routed. Everyone is then sent home, but Magus ambushes them before they reach the ranch. A battle of wits takes place and Magus is again beaten. The villain does exact a final revenge as our heroes return home and find the ranch destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lisa has Grimalkin bring them one last token, a new ranch and home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
