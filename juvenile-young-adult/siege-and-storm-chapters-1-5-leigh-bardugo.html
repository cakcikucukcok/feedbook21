      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Download the first five chapters of the widely anticipated SIEGE &amp; STORM, book two in The Grisha Trilogy!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Darkness never dies...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hunted across the True Sea, haunted by the lives she took on the Fold, Alina must try to make a life with Mal in an unfamiliar land, all while keeping her identity as the Sun Summoner a secret. But she can&#39;t outrun her past or her destiny for long. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Darkling has emerged from the Shadow Fold with a terrifying power and a dangerous plan that will test the very boundaries of the natural world. With the help of a notorious privateer, Alina returns to the country she abandoned, determined to fight the forces gathering against Ravka. But as her power grows, Alina slips deeper into the Darkling&#39;s game of dark magic and control-and farther away from Mal. Now, she will have to choose between her country, her power, and her heart, or risk losing everything to the oncoming storm.&lt;/p&gt;" />
