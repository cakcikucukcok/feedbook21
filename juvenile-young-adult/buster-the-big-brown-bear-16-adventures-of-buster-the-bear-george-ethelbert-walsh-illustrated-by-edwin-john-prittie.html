  <title>BUSTER THE BIG BROWN BEAR - 16 adventures of Buster the Bear - George Ethelbert Walsh, Illustrated by Edwin John Prittie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is for all little boys and girls who love animals.&lt;br /&gt;
BUSTER THE BEAR is brave and fearless in danger, and so lovable that you won&amp;rsquo;t lay down this book without saying wistfully, &amp;ldquo;I almost wish I had him really and truly as a friend and not just a story-book acquaintance.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
This, of course, is a splendid wish; but none of us could afford to have a big brown bear as a friend and living in their house, for that is just what you would have to do if you went outside of the books.&lt;br /&gt;
So we will leave them just where they are&amp;mdash;in the books&amp;mdash;and read about them, and let our imaginations take us to him where we can see them playing, skipping, singing, and sometimes fighting, and if we read very carefully, and &lt;i&gt;think&lt;/i&gt; as we go along, we may come to know them even better than if we went out hunting for them.&lt;br /&gt;
In the meantime, come out into the woods with me, and let us listen and watch, and I promise you it will be worthwhile.&lt;br /&gt;
The stories and adventures of Buster in this volume are:&lt;br /&gt;
I When Buster Was a Cub&lt;br /&gt;
II Buster and Loup&lt;br /&gt;
III How Buster Got Out of the River&lt;br /&gt;
IV Buster is Carried Away by the Men&lt;br /&gt;
V How Buster Was Stolen&lt;br /&gt;
VI Buster&amp;rsquo;s Cruel Masters&lt;br /&gt;
VII Buster Makes His Escape&lt;br /&gt;
VIII Buster&amp;rsquo;s First Public Appearance&lt;br /&gt;
IX Buster Saves Chiquita&lt;br /&gt;
X Buster Becomes a Trick Bear&lt;br /&gt;
XI Buster In a Railroad Wreck&lt;br /&gt;
XII Buster Meets the Little Girl Again&lt;br /&gt;
XIII Buster and the Little Girl&lt;br /&gt;
XIV Buster Tries to Escape and is Discovered&lt;br /&gt;
XV Buster is to be Sent to the Zoo&lt;br /&gt;
XVI Buster Returns to the North Woods&lt;br /&gt;
This volume is sure to keep you and your young ones enchanted for hours, if not because of the quantity, then their quality. They will have you coming back for more time and again.&lt;br /&gt;
