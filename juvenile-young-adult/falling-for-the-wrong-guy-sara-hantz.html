  <title>Falling For the Wrong Guy - Sara Hantz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;Such a great story about healing wounds and forgetting the past. Something I relate to, yet again. There were parts that just wrenched my heart from my chest, and I felt like crying. Only the best books can do that to me, and this book is that great. Also, is the cover not the cutest?!&quot; &lt;b&gt;-Haddie&#39;s Haven&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ruby Davis has a crush on her brother&#39;s best friend. At least, he was his bestie until the big betrayal. Now Drew is off limits to everyone, especially Ruby. She can&#39;t stand the way people treat him, or the way he feels about himself. It isn&#39;t right.  And those deep green eyes are calling to her. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Drew is scarred and damaged, and he has no business even looking at Ruby. But he can&#39;t help himself. She&#39;s beautiful, but he does his best to stay away. When they are assigned a school project, they become reluctant friends - even though they want so much more.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She&#39;s torn between her feelings for Drew and loyalty to her brother. There&#39;s no way they can ever be together...but love just might find a way&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Disclaimer: This Entangled Teen Crush book contains forbidden love, a scarred and damaged hero, an overprotective brother out for revenge, and a heart-wrenching ending that may bring on happy tears.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
