      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The last time Jess saw her father, she was a boy. Now she&#39;s a high school graduate, soon to be on her way to art school. But first she has some unfinished business with her dad. So she&#39;s driving halfway across the country to his wedding. He happens to be marrying her mom&#39;s ex-best friend.
