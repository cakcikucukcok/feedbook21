      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s spring of their fifth-grade year and Rip and Red have a thrilling opportunity to participate in a weekend basketball tournament with a few other members of Clifton United. While the tournament is only a short bus ride away, both boys will travel outside their comfort zones. Ultra-competitive Rip must play on a team with kids he doesn&#39;t like. But he faces an even bigger hurdle when someone from his past returns, someone he hasn&#39;t seen in years, someone who just may derail the entire weekend. As for Red, because of his autism spectrum disorder, he&#39;s never traveled anywhere without his mother. Will he muster the courage to take the trip? Fortunately for both boys, also on the team is an unlikely addition, a source of inspiration who helps everyone discover the true meaning of the word &lt;i&gt;champion. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Tournament of Champions &lt;/i&gt;is the third book in Phil Bildner&#39;s Rip and Red series.&lt;/p&gt;" />
