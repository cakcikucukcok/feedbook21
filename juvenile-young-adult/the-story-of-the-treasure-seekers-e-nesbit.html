  <title>The Story of the Treasure Seekers - E. Nesbit</title>
      <meta name="description" content="From the author of &lt;I&gt;The Railway Children&lt;/I&gt; and &lt;I&gt;Five Children and It&lt;/I&gt; comes this tale of six siblings and their adventures in Victorian London. The Bastable children are deeply saddened by&amp;nbsp;the death of their mother, and to make things worse, they&#39;re impoverished when their father&#39;s business fails. Determined to restore both the family&#39;s fortune and its good name, the young Bastables embark on a variety of hilarious get-rich-quick schemes.&lt;BR&gt;Each chapter details a new adventure, from digging for treasure and becoming detectives and highway robbers, to writing a newspaper and selling wine. The children accost a nobleman on Blackheath and are mistaken for blackmailers, pay a visit to a moneylender, encounter a royal princess in Greenwich Park, and earnestly pursue other comic ventures. Their courage and determination provide a heartwarming complement to the droll narrative, and their hopes, disappointments, and triumphs remain as real and moving today as they were a century ago." />
