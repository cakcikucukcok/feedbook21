  <title>Heads or Tails - Jack Gantos</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From the Newbery Medal-winning author of &lt;i&gt;Dead End in Norvelt&lt;/i&gt;, eight more hysterical semi-autobiographical Jack Henry stories about a sixth grader&#39;s trials and tribulations&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jack&#39;s life is a crazy roller-coaster ride. At his fifth school in six years, he has a crackpot teacher who won&#39;t give him a break about his lousy handwriting and a secret crush who wants to be a policewoman. At home, he has a pesky little brother with a knack for getting hurt whenever Jack&#39;s supposed to be looking after him, a terror for an older sister, all sorts of weird neighbors, and, last but not least, ferocious alligators in the canal behind his house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Writing in his diary about his good days and bad days is one way Jack survives his up-and-down year. But he&#39;s also a kid who knows that life can go any which way at any given moment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He might as well flip a coin: heads he wins, tails he loses. What will turn up next?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Common Core title.&lt;/p&gt;" />
