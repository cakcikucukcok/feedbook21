      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Petes favorite holiday, Halloween, is coming soon! What will he dress up as this yeara superhero, a vampire, or maybe a firefighter? So many choices! And whats more, hes going to a Halloween party at Libbys house. How exciting!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when Pete and his mom finally make it to the costume shop, only princess and witch costumes are left. Oh no! Luckily, Petes mom comes to the rescue and makes him the best costume ever. On the day of the Halloween party, Petes costume is all set, and he makes sure to bring his special epi-shot, just in case he needs it at the party. But as soon as he gets to the party and sees the party food, he locks himself in the laundry room! Why? Because Pete is allergic to peanuts, and all of the party snacks have peanuts in them! Can Libbys mom find a way to keep Pete safe and help him enjoy the party?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this childrens book, a boy with a peanut allergy runs into a scary situation at a neighborhood Halloween party.&lt;/p&gt;" />
