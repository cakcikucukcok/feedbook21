  <title>Public Enemies - Ann Aguirre</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Public Enemies&lt;/i&gt;, book two of the Immortal Game series, is a darkly fantastic, heart-pounding book by Ann Aguirre, the &lt;i&gt;New York Times-&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;USA Today-&lt;/i&gt;bestselling author of the Razorland series.  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Learn  the rules of the game . . . and then play better than anyone else. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Through a Faustian  bargain, Edie Kramer has been pulled into the dangerous  world of the Immortal  Game, where belief makes your nightmares real.  Hungry for sport,  fears-made-flesh are always raising the stakes. To them, human lives are less than nothing, just pieces on a board. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because  of her boyfriend Kian&#39;s sacrifice, she&#39;s operating under the mysterious  Harbinger&#39;s aegis, but his patronage could prove as fatal as the  opposition. Raw from deepest loss, she&#39;s terrified over the deal Kian made for her. Though her very public enemies keep sending foot  soldiers--mercenary monsters committed to her destruction--she&#39;s not the  one playing under a doom clock. Kian has six months, unless Edie can  save him. And this is a game she can&#39;t bear to lose.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Should  particularly appeal to fans of Ilsa Bick&#39;s &quot;The Dark Passages&quot; series  and Mary Weber&#39;s &quot;The Storm Siren&quot; trilogy. . . . This engaging  nightmare will make even mature horror readers check under the bed at  night.&quot; -&lt;i&gt;School Library Journal&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;The world-building that  creates the dark and suspenseful atmosphere for this story is in full  swing, and readers will enjoy the larger glimpses into the underworld.  The romance between Edie and Kian is also heating up, and Edie gets the  opportunity to act as his guardian. . . . The plot is fast paced and  leads to a suspenseful ending.&quot; -&lt;i&gt;VOYA&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
