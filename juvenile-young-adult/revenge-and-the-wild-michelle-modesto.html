  <title>Revenge and the Wild - Michelle Modesto</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;True Grit&lt;/em&gt; meets &lt;em&gt;True Blood&lt;/em&gt; in this delightfully dark and fantastical Western perfect for fans of Gail Carriger, Cassandra Clare, and Holly Black. This thrilling novel is a remarkable tale of danger and discovery, from debut author Michelle Modesto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two-bit town of Rogue City is a lawless place, full of dark magic and saloon brawls, monsters and six-shooters. But it&amp;#8217;s just perfect for seventeen-year-old Westie, the notorious adopted daughter of local inventor Nigel Butler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Westie was only a child when she lost her arm and her family to cannibals on the wagon trail. Seven years later, Westie may seem fearsome with her foul-mouthed tough exterior and the powerful mechanical arm built for her by Nigel, but the memory of her past still haunts her. She&amp;#8217;s determined to make the killers pay for their crimes&amp;#8212;and there&amp;#8217;s nothing to stop her except her own reckless ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Westie&amp;#8217;s search ceases when a wealthy family comes to town looking to invest in Nigel&amp;#8217;s latest invention, a machine that can harvest magic from gold&amp;#8212;which Rogue City desperately needs as the magic wards that surround the city start to fail. There&amp;#8217;s only one problem: the investors look exactly like the family who murdered Westie&amp;#8217;s kin. With the help of Nigel&amp;#8217;s handsome but scarred young assistant, Alistair, Westie sets out to prove their guilt. But if she&amp;#8217;s not careful, her desire for revenge could cost her the family she has now.&lt;/p&gt;" />
