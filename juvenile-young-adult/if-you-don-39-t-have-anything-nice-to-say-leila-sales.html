  <title>If You Don&#39;t Have Anything Nice to Say - Leila Sales</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A novel about public shaming in the internet age, the power of words, the cumulative destructiveness of microaggressions, and the pressing need for empathy.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Before we go any further, I want you to understand this: I am not a good person.   &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all want to be seen. We all want to be heard. But what happens when we&#39;re seen and heard saying or doing the wrong things?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Winter Halperin--former spelling bee champion, aspiring writer, and daughter of a parenting expert--gets caught saying the wrong thing online, her life explodes. All across the world, people know what she&#39;s done, and none of them will forgive her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;With her friends gone, her future plans cut short, and her identity in shambles, Winter is just trying to pick up the pieces without hurting anyone else. She knows she messed up, but does that mean it&#39;s okay for people to send her hate mail and death threats? Did she deserve to lose all that she&#39;s lost? And is &quot;I&#39;m sorry&quot; ever good enough?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decide for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;" />

Win Rating this book is almost as tough as reading it was. On the one hand, I want to give it three stars because it was a tough read with a main character that I struggled to connect with.<br /><b><i>If You Don't Have Anything Nice to Say by Leila Sales</i></b> | Leila Sales is the author of many critically acclaimed young adult novels including This Song Will Save Your Life, If You Don't Have Anything Nice to Say, and Tonight the Streets Are Ours.<br /><b><i>If You Don’t Have Anything Nice To Say | Leila Sales</i></b> | If You Don’t Have Anything Nice to Say is very plot driven without being high action. The focus of the story is squarely on what Winter did and the aftermath. The contrast between Winter confronting her own internalized bigotry/racism while also being subjected to such intense online shaming is incredibly powerful and thought provoking.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>If You Don&#39;t Have Anything Nice to Say - Leila Sales</a> </h3></p><hr/>
