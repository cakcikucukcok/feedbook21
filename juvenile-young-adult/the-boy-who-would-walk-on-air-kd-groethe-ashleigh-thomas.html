  <title>The Boy Who Would Walk on Air - Kd Groethe, Ashleigh Thomas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Tommo dreamed; Tommo wished, and Tommo believed he could Walk On Air. 
One day, Takli, Tommos best friend, made it happen! And for both! 
She had the power. Taklis Chinese grandfather had left her with the ability to perform wondrous things. 
Nica, Taklis other best friend, a Chinese whistling duck, taught himself to whistle speak by watching Harpo Marx, of The Marx Brothers. Harpo spoke to his TV brothers in this manner. Tommo and Takli eventually understood every word Nica whistled.
When it happened! When the fog surrounded them, Tommo and Takli were walking above a forest of Maples while Nica flew. They felt lost until they saw the golden escalator. Stepping on, they rode it to The Land of Sweet Illusions.
This land, made from candy and ice cream, was ruled by King Hagen Das and Queen Bunny Blue. There, the trio met characters from fairy tales and plays: UntilThe Sultan of Sour from The Land of Sour tried to overthrow King Hagen. 
Nica became everyones hero, wreaking the Sultans plans and driving him away while all others sat hypnotized.
After saving King Hagens kingdom, Tommo, Takli and Nica left to find the golden escalator that would take them home. Success! But it stopped, OMG in the Land of Sour where everyone and everything was pickley green and mean. There they met two witches, happy Abra and miserable Kadabra. They were then taken by the Cheesed Off Police to the Sultan of Sour. They couldnt leave until they had made all greenies smile and giggle and laughan impossibility. Butwith                                                 h the help of Abra and Kadabra and a plan, Tommo, Takli and Nica made em laugh and were allowed to go home. Was it an illusion? Was it real? Only Tommo and Takli knew for sure." />
