  <title>Toto&#39;s Tale and True Chronicle of Oz - Sylvia Patience</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wonderful&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Wizard of Oz&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;was written in 1900 by L. Frank Baum. Many other Oz books followed, as well as the famous 1939 movie. Not until now, however, does Toto tell the story, as he remembers it. In&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Toto&amp;rsquo;s Tale,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;we read his version of the beloved adventures. Toto tells how he found Dorothy when she arrived in Kansas on an orphan train and how they were both adopted by Aunt Em and Uncle Henry.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The little dog becomes frustrated at being the only one of the Oz adventurers who can&amp;rsquo;t talk. Just as the Scarecrow longs for a brain, the Tin Man for a heart, and the Lion for courage, Toto wants the power of speech.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Based on the book, not the movie, Toto confirms much of what Baum originally wrote, with new twists, from his unique doggy point of view. Several of the delightful original illustrations&amp;nbsp;by W.W. Denslow from The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&amp;nbsp;are included.&lt;/p&gt;" />
