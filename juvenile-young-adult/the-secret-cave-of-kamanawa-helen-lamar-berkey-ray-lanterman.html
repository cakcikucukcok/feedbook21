  <title>The Secret Cave of Kamanawa - Helen Lamar Berkey, Ray Lanterman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;B&gt;A classic story, this young adult adventure book takes readers to the Hawaiian Islands.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;The Secret Cave of Kamanawa&lt;/I&gt; is a story about a secret burial cave of an old Hawaiian &lt;/I&gt;ali&amp;#8217;i&lt;/I&gt; or chief.  It provides the adventure which both the main characther, &quot;Boy&quot; and the reader experience.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The Hawaiian chief is an ancestor of the Cat-Woman, and she is rightfully proud as she tells of how he gained in marriage the hand of a lovely Molokai princess. And when she tells Boy of the ritual of burying chiefs in secluded caves, she is not aware that anyone would attempt to find them, much less the youngster who is eagerly clinging to her every word.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The search for the cave takes you over the mountainous terrain of Hawaii, much as you would find it if you were to go there now. This is a story which might take place even today in Hawaii; who knows, perhaps you can do exactly what Boy did in searching for &lt;I&gt;The Secret Cave of Kamanawa.&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
