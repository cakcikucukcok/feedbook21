  <title>Planet Tad - Tim Carvell, Doug Holgate</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Twelve-year-old Tad is a blogger with a plan, in the book Jon Stewart calls &amp;#34;hilarious to anyone who ever went through, is currently in, might go to, or flunked out of middle school.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tad has an agenda: Survive seventh grade. He &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; wants to: grow a mustache, get girls to notice him, and do a kickflip on his skateboard. But those are not the main reasons he started a blog. Tad just has a lot of important thoughts he wants to share with the world, like: &lt;em&gt;Here is the first thing I have learned about having a dog in your house: Don&amp;#39;t feed them nachos. Not ever. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This highly illustrated and hilarious book is by the Emmy&amp;#174; Award-winning former head writer of &lt;em&gt;The Daily Show with Jon Stewart&lt;/em&gt;, and is based on a column in &lt;em&gt;MAD Magazine&lt;/em&gt;.
