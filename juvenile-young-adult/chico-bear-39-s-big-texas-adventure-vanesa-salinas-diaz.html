  <title>Chico Bear&#39;s Big Texas Adventure - Vanesa Salinas-Diaz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book has wonderful illustrations by Kristin Bato.  One night, after his mom tucks him in, Chico Bear hears the sound of a woman crying outside his cozy Minnesota home. He creeps out to comfort her. Her name is Miss Higgins, and she is so, so lonely. When Chico Bear agrees to be her friend, though, she scoops him up and takes him away!   They drive for miles and miles until they arrive on her farm in Texas. It&#39;s too hot for Chico Bear at the farm, and there&#39;s nowhere to take a bath. He&#39;s lucky to meet young cowboy Freckles, because it&#39;s Freckles who saves Chico Bear from Miss Higgins and helps him find a way home-but no adventure is easy!   To get back to his mom, Chico Bear rides a pig and a horse. He escapes from an angry rattlesnake. Freckles even lets him play cowboy for a while! Little Chico Bear travels far and wide but eventually makes it back home, safe and sound. He learns that he should never talk to strangers, no matter how friendly they seem." />
