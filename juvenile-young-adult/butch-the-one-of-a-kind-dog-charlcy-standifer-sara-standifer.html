  <title>Butch the One-Of-A-Kind Dog - Charlcy Standifer, Sara Standifer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Butch is a happy little dachshund who looks just like his mother. Its no wonder that Ned and his sister, Ellen, fall in love with Butch and take him home with them. At his new home, Butch makes a friend in Nanny, a kindly pet goat who takes the excited young Butch on a tour of his new home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything is perfect. Tired and content after a long walk with Nanny, Butch falls asleep in his favorite spot and naps peacefullyuntil the delivery man arrives and laughs at him. Butch listens as the delivery man tells his family that Butch is the funniest looking dog hes ever seen. Now Butch is very unhappy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nanny overhears the conversation and knows its up to her to cheer Butch up. But she doesnt know what to say. Nanny convinces Butch to take another walk with her. As they walk, however, Nanny is kidnapped! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now its up to Butch to save Nanny, but hes going to need help. Can Butch find a way to tell Ned and Ellen that Nanny needs their help?&lt;/p&gt;" />
