  <title>Zulu Dog - Anton Ferreira</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;An honest and compassionate look at post-apartheid South Africa&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vusi, an eleven-year-old Zulu boy growing up in poverty in rural South Africa, is enchanted by the helpless puppy he finds in the bush. He names it Gillette for its razor-sharp teeth and hides it from his mother, who disapproves of bush dogs as pets. His devotion to Gillette only grows stronger after the puppy is mauled by a leopard and loses a leg. But as boy and dog play carefree games, storm clouds are gathering over Vusi&#39;s family - ruthless rival taxi owners are trying to drive his father out of business. While Vusi and Gillette learn to hunt together, they meet the daughter of a neighboring white farmer. Gillette becomes the catalyst for their unlikely friendship, which has a decisive impact on the fate of Vusi&#39;s whole family - and the larger community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A starkly realistic story set against the backdrop of the country&#39;s tortured racial history, &lt;i&gt;Zulu Dog&lt;/i&gt; holds out the hope that a new generation of South Africans can create a better future for their land.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Zulu Dog&lt;/i&gt; is a 2003 Bank Street - Best Children&#39;s Book of the Year.&lt;/p&gt;" />
