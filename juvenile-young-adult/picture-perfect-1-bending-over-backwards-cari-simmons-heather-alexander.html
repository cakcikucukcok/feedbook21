      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Being one half of a BFF heart necklace is serious business&amp;#8212;and in the Picture Perfect series, each story tackles a tough friendship challenge. Through the ups and downs of life in middle school, through braces and boy bands, family feuds and fashion disasters, your best bud is there. But what happens when friendship suddenly gets complicated? Tween readers will adore these sweet, accessible stories about the power of friendship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Molly Larsen can&amp;#39;t believe this is happening. She had an awesome life in Arizona&amp;#8212;a great best friend, a prime spot on her gymnastics squad, and a built-in pool in her backyard. But now she and her family are moving&amp;#8212;to New Jersey! Luckily, her best friend, Eden, has a plan: Molly is going to rule her new school by becoming friends with Roseann Bleeker, the most superpopular girl in class!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon Molly sees that impressing Roseann is tougher than she&amp;#39;d expected. Just about the only person in the Garden State who seems to &amp;#34;get&amp;#34; Molly is her neighbor Shrimp. But Shrimp is as far from popular as anyone can be. Is Molly doomed to a friendless life on the East Coast? Or can she find her place?&lt;/p&gt;" />
