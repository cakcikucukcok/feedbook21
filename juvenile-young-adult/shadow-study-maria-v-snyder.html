      <meta name="description" content="&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; bestselling author Maria V.

But she&amp;#8217;d survived to become a vital part of the balance of power between rival countries Ixia and Sitia. Now she uses her magic to keep the peace in both lands&amp;#8212;and protect her relationship with Valek.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;Suddenly, though, they are beset on all sides by those vying for power through politics and intrigue. Valek&amp;#8217;s job and his life are in danger. As Yelena tries to uncover the scope of these plots, she faces a new challenge: her magic is blocked. She must keep that a secret&amp;#8212;or her enemies will discover just how vulnerable she really is&amp;#8212;while searching for who or what is responsible for neutralizing her powers.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;Yes, the days of tasting poisons were much simpler. And certainly not as dangerous&amp;#8230;" />
