  <title>The Kingdon of No Worries - Philip Roy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Kingdom of No Worries is the story of three young friends who create their own kingdom on a piece of land that emerges in the middle of the river that runs through their city. Inspired by their actions to create a democracy that is a model of social tolerance and global thinking, the surrounding community turns out in the thousands to participate in what becomes a radical cultural hub of the city. Over the course of one hot summer the boys grapple to learn what a democracy is and to oversee its demands. Alas, their nascent sovereignty is challenged first by a civic order of eviction, then by valid First Nations land claims, and ultimately by nature itself. Can the utopian dream be saved? The Kingdom of No Worries is an empowering tale that speaks to the archetypal dream that all children have to create their own world." />
