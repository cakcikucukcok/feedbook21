  <title>Stinky Feet, the Dragon - Rhonda Stewart, Cortni Green</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, there was a young dragon named Elvin. He was a beautiful dragon, with colors that shimmered and gleamed, and his scales looked like beautifully painted glass that sparkled. The most wonderful thing about Elvin, though, was that he was just as beautiful on the inside as on the outside. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Elvin had one big problem. He had stinky feet, really stinky feet. In fact, his feet smelled so smelly that none of the kids would play with him, and his nickname became Stinky Feet. That made Elvin very sad. His mom, who loved Elvin so much, gave him a special gift that allowed him to play with his friends again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stinky Feet, the Dragon, a picture book for children, tells the story of a special young dragon who discovers that problems dont have to control your life. With the help of family and friends, lifes little issues can easily turn into rainbows.&lt;/p&gt;" />
