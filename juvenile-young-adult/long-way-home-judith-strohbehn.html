  <title>Long Way Home - Judith Strohbehn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="That nights beating was the worst so far, and fifteen-year-old Gage Conners vowed it would be the last. He would leave his stepfathers home and go to live with his older brother, Charlie. However, Gage has lost contact with Charlie and must walk nearly five hundred miles to his brothers last known address in hopes of finding him. 
The only one to know about Gages stealthy escape is his best friend and unwilling accomplice, Will Mortenson. Over Wills protests, Gage sets out walking the back roads between Illinois and Nebraska, facing challenges brought on by harsh elements and gun-toting hog farmers, as well as triumphs, which include visits from the spirit of his dead mother and the meeting of a girl, with whom he discovers a unique kind of love. 
Meanwhile, Will waits at home, balancing the worry over his friends safety and the guilt of covering for him with the daily stresses of track, school, and his uncertain relationship with a girl named Julie. 
It is a challenging time for both teens as they encounter people and events that profoundly impact their views on life, love, friendship, and the meaning of home." />
