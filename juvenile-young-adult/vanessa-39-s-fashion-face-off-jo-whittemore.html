  <title>Vanessa&#39;s Fashion Face-Off - Jo Whittemore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Perfect for fans of The Cupcake Diaries and The Babysitters Club, this new series is about four best friends who are confidentially yours when writing their middle school newspaper&amp;#39;s advice column.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vanessa Jackson has style to spare and an amazing ability to rock any look. She&amp;#39;s always had a flair for fashion, and dreams of being a designer one day. She&amp;#39;s loving middle school, and being on the newspaper staff with her two best friends is a blast. Vanessa knows her fashion advice is always on point for the group&amp;#39;s popular advice column.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But then she meets her new neighbor, Katie Kestler. Katie is cute, super-stylish, and just moved from glamorous LA. When Katie ends up attending the same middle school, suddenly it seems like Katie&amp;#39;s everywhere, and not in a good way. But when an advice-off competition threatens Vanessa&amp;#39;s spot on the column, she&amp;#39;s determined to take Katie down.&lt;/p&gt;" />
