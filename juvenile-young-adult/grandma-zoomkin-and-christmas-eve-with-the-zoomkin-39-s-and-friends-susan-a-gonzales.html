  <title>Grandma Zoomkin and Christmas Eve with the Zoomkin&#39;s and Friends - Susan A. Gonzales</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It will be exciting to see the different styles of fantasy drawings and imaginary settings I have portrayed to invite the readers eye and the viewers interest. There are thrills of fantasy and mystery events on every page with a lot of color that will be exciting. It contains a Christmas-motif setting, such as nice and colorful reds, greens, and yellows; bright characters; and whimsical gaiety for children and adults alike. It will be a story where Grandma Zoomkin takes the gifts on Christmas Eve, but no one knows where. She takes the gifts and stores them in a secret place. The mystery is that no one knows where they were hidden. Time is running out, and the gifts are nowhere to be found.
It could be that Grandma Zoomkin the elder wanted to show the little Zoomkins who was naughty or nice on Christmas Eve and maybe have fun, too, on that day! Anyway, that is the story. It will be a fun story and amusing for that event. It is colorful and fun in mystery for the reader and the viewer. It is about how Grandma Zoomkin has a good surprise for everyone and makes everyone happy again! It is a bright Christmas Eve again. A mystery wonder is found!" />
