  <title>In the Country of Queens - Cari Best</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;An Amazon Best Book of the Month&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eleven-year-old Shirley Alice Burns lives with her domineering mother, Hurricane Anna, and loving Grandmother. One day she unexpectedly discovers that her beloved father isn&#39;t in Absentia as her family would have her believe, but dead. And she understands all too well why they haven&#39;t told her; she&#39;s always been shy and quiet, and Anna has always been protective of her. But if Shirley doesn&#39;t start speaking up, she isn&#39;t going to be able to do the things she wants to do: go on vacation to Lake Winnipesaukee with her cousins, stop taking ballet lessons, and talk about her father. Through the help of a mouse, her hero Pippi Longstocking, and her cousin Phillie, Shirley finds the strength to give her dreams a voice and convince everyone, even Hurricane Anna, that she doesn&#39;t need to be sheltered, especially from the truth. &lt;i&gt;In the Country of Queens&lt;/i&gt; is the debut novel from acclaimed picture-book author Cari Best.&lt;/p&gt;" />
