  <title>Deadtime Stories: Grandpa&#39;s Monster Movies - Annette Cascone, Gina Cascone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Deadtime Stories by &quot;Twisted Sisters&quot; Annette and Gina Cascone-they&#39;ll scare you silly and give you giggles at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;C. T. and his cousin Lea are staying at their grandparents&#39; old farmhouse. It&#39;s Grandpa&#39;s seventieth birthday, and everyone&#39;s celebrating with a big family reunion. All the weird relatives are here, and all they seem to want to talk about are &quot;the good old days.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;C. T. and Lea think &quot;the good old days&quot; are pretty boring-until they find some home movies hidden away in the attic, movies from when their grandfather was just a boy. The home movies give them a piece of family history that the relatives never talked about. It seems that horses, cows, pigs, and chickens aren&#39;t the only creatures Grandpa&#39;s been taking care of on the farm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;C. T. and Lea discover there&#39;s a monster among them-and this creature is dying to eat a lot more than the birthday cake! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hill &amp; Brand Entertainment has inked a deal with Cookie Jar Entertainment to distribute (worldwide) the first season of 26 half-hour, live-action episodes based on the Deadtime Stories books. &quot;Grave Secrets&quot; will serve as the pilot episode(s). Cookie Jar distributes over 6,000 episodes of kid&#39;s television programming around the world and serves as a worldwide merchandising agent for the properties. Previously, they were the producers (together with Nickelodeon) and distributors of the very successful Nick show &quot;Are You Afraid of the Dark.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
