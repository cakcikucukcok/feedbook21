  <title>INDIAN LEGENDS OF VANCOUVER ISLAND - 17 Native American Legends - Anon E. Mouse, Compiled and Edited by Alfred Carmichael, Illustrated by J. Semeyn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;A great read for children and great for reading around campfires!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Herein you will find seventeen stories of adventure and legend from Vancouver Island, or the land known as Wakash Nation. Stories like &amp;ldquo;&lt;i&gt;The Legend Of The Thunder Birds&lt;/i&gt;&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;&lt;i&gt;How Shewish Became A Great Whale Hunter&lt;/i&gt;&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;&lt;i&gt;The Finding Of The Tsomass&lt;/i&gt;&amp;rdquo; and of course &amp;ldquo;&lt;i&gt;The Legends of Eut-Le-Ten&lt;/i&gt;&amp;rdquo;, Vancouver Island&amp;rsquo;s own Maui.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Here you will read stories of the lone Indian paddling his canoe on the waters of the Western sounds, savouring the scent of cedar hidden amongst the Toh-a-mupt, or Sitca, spruce, with it&amp;rsquo;s scaly bark and prickly spine; the feathery foliage of the Quilth-kla-mupt, the western hemlock. The frond-like branches and aromatic scent betray to him the much-prized Hohm-ess, the giant cedar tree, from which he carves his staunch canoe.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These are the woods in which Eut-Le-Ten roamed and hunted and dreamed of winning the hand of Nas-nas-shup&amp;rsquo;s daughter who resided in land beyond the sky. Enamoured with this thought, Eut-Le-Ten shot arrow after arrow towards heaven making a rope of shafts. Then when his rope was high enough, he climbed the rope to land above and beyond to claim the hand of Nas-nas-shup&amp;rsquo;s daughter. Read about this in &amp;ldquo;&lt;i&gt;The Arrow Chain To Heaven&lt;/i&gt;&amp;rdquo;. But claiming his princess would not be as simple as he thought. Armed with the charms he received after helping &amp;ldquo;&lt;i&gt;The Two Blind Squaws&lt;/i&gt;&amp;rdquo;, he had to overcome &amp;ldquo;&lt;i&gt;The Four Terrors Guarding The House Of Nas-Nas-Shup&lt;/i&gt;&amp;rdquo; and the endure &amp;ldquo;&lt;i&gt;The Trial By Fire&lt;/i&gt;&amp;rdquo; before he could eventually claim his bride. Eut-le-ten eventually returned to earth and was counted as a chief more learned than any that had ever been.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So, after you have downloaded this unique volume, find a comfy chair and be prepared to be entertained.&lt;br /&gt;
