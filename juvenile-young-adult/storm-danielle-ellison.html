      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A little salt. And a whole lot of magic...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Up until recently, Penelope was a witch with no magic. After having it stolen by a demon when she was just a child, Penelope had been forced to rely on sharing others&#39; powers as she went through the grueling training required to become an elite demon hunter. Now Penelope has more magic than she&#39;s ever known. And when you&#39;re this powerful, who needs salt to keep the demons away?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But power has a dark side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carter Prescott just wants to hunt demons and be with Penelope. But suddenly, witches who formerly had no magic are developing out-of-control powers. Now the world Carter swore to protect isn&#39;t just endangered by malicious demons?it&#39;s threatened by the same witches who once defended it. And Carter is horrified to see his girlfriend starting to change. Stronger. More powerful. &lt;i&gt;Unrecognizable&lt;/i&gt;. It&#39;s just a matter of time before Penelope transforms into something far beyond his worst fears...&lt;/p&gt;" />
