  <title>Life by Committee - Corey Ann Haydu</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Secret: I kissed someone else&#39;s boyfriend. &lt;br /&gt;Assignment: Do it again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like most who find Life by Committee, Tabitha is a little lost. Her best friend has ditched her, her Vermont town is feeling way too small, and she&#39;s falling head over heels for a guy named Joe&amp;#8212;who already has a girlfriend. Just when Tab is afraid she&#39;ll burst from keeping the secret of Joe inside, she discovers Life by Committee. The rules of LBC are simple: tell a secret, receive an assignment. Complete the assignment to keep your secret safe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tab likes it that the assignments push her to her limits, empowering her to live boldly and go further than she&#39;d ever go on her own. But in the name of truth and bravery, how far is too far to go?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perfect for fans of E. Lockhart and Jennifer E. Smith, &lt;em&gt;Life by Committee&lt;/em&gt; is a fresh, vibrant novel about the power of wanting, the messiness of friendship, and the truths we hide and share. &lt;/p&gt;" />
