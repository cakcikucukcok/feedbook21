  <title>Tales of the Giant Cookie - Jodi Lee Berman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Giant Cookie is taller than the tallest skyscraper and bigger than a whole city block. His heart is even bigger than his size and he is the nicest cookie you would ever want to meet. He enjoys spending time with boys and girls and on this day, he wants to join them on the playground. Except there is one rather serious problem: the Giant Cookie cant fit! He is too big!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The children are having so much fun on the jungle gym, swings, merry-go-round, and in the sandbox, too. However, the Giant Cookie cant participate due to his enormous size. What if the kids can find a solution to his problem? Working together, they think up a wonderful idea that will get the Giant Cookie on the playground.&lt;/p&gt;" />
