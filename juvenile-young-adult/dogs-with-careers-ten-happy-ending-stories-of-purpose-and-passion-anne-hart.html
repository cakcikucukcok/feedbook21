  <title>Dogs with Careers: Ten Happy-Ending Stories of Purpose and Passion - Anne Hart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;They&#39;re library dogs, Charlie. They&#39;re all dog-faces,&quot; laughed the space station manager, as he waved goodnight to his security dogs and locked the gates. &quot;They&#39;re not just dogs with jobs, but detective canines with investigative sniffing careers at the space station and in outer space.&quot;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;At night, the space station&#39;s library is eerie, dim lighted, and in places, simply velvet-shadow dark, except for the human&#39;s dogs. They mingle with the shape-shifting immortal space dogs that prowl the space station library&#39;s corridors and live among the rows of computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Career dogs just want to have fun traveling onboard the space shuttles as working companion dogs, never locked behind gates. These dogs don&#39;t bite. They are dogs with purpose and passion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a team of working dogs that can shape-shift from dog to human and human to dog live outside of time. And in this century, they work for a mother and daughter astronaut team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Which dog sprayed wolf graffiti on the space shuttle?&quot; A ground controller dog, a mellow, Chocolate Labrador retriever, studied the photo. &quot;But how did it get there?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Maybe it&#39;s a paste-on tattoo that the astronauts put on board to celebrate all those years here,&quot; the pack leader howled in a licorice-sweet yelp. The omega canine hurried to switch off another computer.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&#39;Retriever,&#39; formerly a &quot;library greeter dog&quot; but now the ground controller&#39;s pet, sniffed with curiosity. He stretched and curled up on top of the filing cabinet.&lt;/p&gt;" />
