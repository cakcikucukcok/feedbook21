  <title>Chance Fortune and the Outlaws - Shane Berryhill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For as long as he can remember, fourteen-year-old Joshua Blevins has wanted to be a superhero. He has the brains, the passion, and the heart. There&#39;s only one problem: he doesn&#39;t have any superpowers. But Josh isn&#39;t about to let that stop him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Determined not to give up on his dream, Josh enlists the aid of his mentor, Captain Fearless, a retired costumed adventurer, to gain entrance to the Burlington Academy for the Superhuman under the false identity of Chance Fortune--a superhuman with the power of having unnaturally good luck. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Masquerading as Chance, Josh rises among the ranks of his fellow students at the Academy, eventually becoming the leader of his own combat team, the Outlaws. Together, Chance and his teammates Psy-Chick, Shocker, Gothika, Space Cadet, Iron Maiden, and Private Justice make new friends, battle new enemies, and ultimately find themselves caught up in a struggle for the fate of the universe. Can Chance and the Outlaws save the universe--&lt;i&gt;AND &lt;/i&gt;survive their freshman year?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
