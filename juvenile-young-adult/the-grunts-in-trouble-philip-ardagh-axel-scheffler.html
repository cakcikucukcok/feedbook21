  <title>The Grunts in Trouble - Philip Ardagh, Axel Scheffler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Meet Mr and Mrs Grunt. Oh, go on. They&#39;re not that bad. No, actually, they ARE. Maybe worse, even. But Sunny, their sort-of son, is okay. They stole him from a washing line as a baby. He was hanging by his ears, which probably explains why they&#39;re so wonky (but not why he has sticky-up hair that NEVER lies flat even if you pour glue into it or try taping it in place). Stick around and you&#39;ll also meet Lord Bigg of Bigg Manor, Bigg-hater Larry Smalls, Mimi the Bigg Manor bootboy (yup, she&#39;s a girl) and...Well, you&#39;ll have to READ the book to find that out. But I should mention the bees. Did I warn you about the bees?!" />
