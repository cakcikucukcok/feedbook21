  <title>Harvey Plumstead and the Dinnertime Dog - Roland Bond</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It is dinnertime at Middlemoor Primary School, and ten-year-old Harvey Plumstead is in the playground with his friends. Although he has a reputation for being a troublesome boy, Harvey is never deliberately naughty. But he must be the unluckiest boy in the world because everything he touches turns out to be a complete disaster. Perhaps things will be different today. When a large dog appears on the pavement outside the school gate, Harvey is convinced it must be lost. Determined to help this dog, he decides to inform the Head who he is sure will be delighted with him. But will Harvey succeed in impressing the Head for once, or will he simply get himself into even more trouble?" />
