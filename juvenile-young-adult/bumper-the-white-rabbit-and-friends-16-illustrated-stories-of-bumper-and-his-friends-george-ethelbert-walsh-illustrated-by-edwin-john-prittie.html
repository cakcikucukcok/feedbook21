  <title>BUMPER THE WHITE RABBIT AND FRIENDS - 16 illustrated stories of Bumper and his Friends - George Ethelbert Walsh, Illustrated by Edwin John Prittie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Herein are 16 illustrated stories about &amp;ldquo;Bumper the White Rabbit and His Friends.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is a companion volume to &amp;ldquo;Bumper the White Rabbit&amp;rdquo; which also contains 16 illustrated stories about the adventures of Bumper and his friends.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
All boys and girls who love reading and who love animals should become acquainted with Bumper the white rabbit, with Bobby Gray Squirrel, with Buster the Bear, and with White Tail the deer, for they are all brave and fearless in danger, and so lovable that you won&amp;rsquo;t lay down any one of the books without saying wistfully, &amp;ldquo;I almost wish I had them really and truly as friends and not just storybook acquaintances.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
That, of course, is a splendid wish; but none of us could afford to have a big menagerie of wild animals, for that&amp;rsquo;s just what you would have to do if you brought the books to life.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Bumper has many friends, such as Mr. Blind Rabbit, Fuzzy Wuzz and Goggle Eyes, his country cousins; and Bobby Gray Squirrel had his near cousins, Stripe the chipmunk and Webb the flying squirrel; while Buster and White Tail were favoured with an endless number of friends and relatives. If we turned them all loose from the books, and put them in a ten-acre lot&amp;mdash;but no, ten acres wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be big enough to accommodate them, perhaps not even a hundred acres.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The stories and adventures of Bumper in this volume are:&lt;br /&gt;
I Bumper And&amp;nbsp; Sleepy The Opossum&lt;br /&gt;
II Browny The Muskrat&lt;br /&gt;
III Billy The Mink&lt;br /&gt;
IV Mr. Beaver Has A Surprise&lt;br /&gt;
V The Terrible News&amp;nbsp; The Birds Brought&lt;br /&gt;
VI The Fire In The Woods&lt;br /&gt;
VII Bumper&amp;rsquo;s Mad Race&amp;nbsp; With The Fire&lt;br /&gt;
VIII How They Crossed&amp;nbsp; The River&lt;br /&gt;
IX The Truce&lt;br /&gt;
X House Hunting&amp;nbsp; In The Woods&lt;br /&gt;
XI Pink Nose And&amp;nbsp; Rolly Polly&lt;br /&gt;
XII Downy The Woodpecker And Belt The Sapsucker&lt;br /&gt;
XIII How Killer The Snake Broke The Truce&lt;br /&gt;
XIV An Adventure With Sneaky And Mr. Fox&lt;br /&gt;
XV What Happened&amp;nbsp; At The Bottom Of The Pit&lt;br /&gt;
XVI What Buster Did To Loup, Sneaky And Mr. Fox&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This volume is sure to keep you and your young ones enchanted for hours, if not because of the quantity, then their quality. They will have you coming back for more time and again.&lt;br /&gt;
