  <title>The Three Thieves and the Magic Tears - Sheila Silverman Taube, Avery Liell-Kok</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Thoroughly realized and lovingly told, THE THREE THIEVES AND THE MAGIC TEARS presents a robustly imagined world. In addition to this world building, readers will enjoy well developed characters and a new twist on the popular quest narrative.  BlueInk Review
Taubes fanciful, page-turning tale will charm all. She has created quite a world  whimsical enough for kids but evolved enough to keep adults engaged. The theme of facing ones fears, as seen here, is universal. Taube deals with this oft- considered idea in a way thats not at all hokey: sometimes things are scary, and people have to learn to cope in their own ways. A fun, fancy-free look at facing ones fears and aiming for forgiveness.  Kirkus Reviews
Taube does a splendid job describing characters and events, her use of adjectives paints strong pictures for children. The varied dialogue of the thieves, Nana Ida, and each character in the four lands speaks volumes about their motivations and traits. Based on the last page, it seems Taube will eventually be writing a sequel (she should).  Foreword Clarion Reviews
Can a childrens book be about the stupidity of greed, cowardice, courage, valor, self-sacrifice, personal redemption and the value of the earth and its elements? 
THE THREE THIEVES AND THE MAGIC TEARS is. 
Our three thieves begin a journey to kidnap a magical little old woman with the remarkable gift of her tears falling as diamonds. To find her they are led to the four corners of the dark forest. They meet frightening circumstances in each land, beginning with a giant Whitewolf and four starving pups in the Land of the North. They must prevail or become food for the wolves. In the Land of the East they are met by fairies, elves and people who walk on air to avoid bubbling pools of scalding water. They learn about wind that is used to talk with other villages, the wind that aids them to climb a mountain, and a hurricane that once again almost destroys them. In the Land of the South they come perilously close to dying of thirst because of their ignorance of the desert. They meet the people of the south called Firewalkers and a wisewoman with a red hot finger of truth. In the Land of the West they finally find a watery, diamond strewn pathway that will lead them to the magic old woman 
Their transformation begins when they meet Nana Ida who sends them on a journey of redemption where each of them must face the things that terrifies them the most. They must pass the grotesque Guardians of the Pool of Transformation. Each Guardian forces them to face their personal nightmares. How they survive brings the climax of the story, but not necessarily the end of the tale." />
