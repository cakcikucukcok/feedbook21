  <title>738 Days - Stacey Kade</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;At fifteen, Amanda Grace was abducted on her way home from school. 738 days later, she escaped. Her 20/20 interview is what everyone remembers--Amanda describing the room where she was kept, the torn poster of TV heartthrob Chase Henry on the wall. It reminded her of home and gave her the strength to keep fighting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, years later, Amanda is struggling to live normally. Her friends have gone on to college, while she battles PTSD. She&#39;s not getting any better, and she fears that if something doesn&#39;t change soon she never will.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six years ago, Chase Henry defied astronomical odds, won a coveted role on a new TV show, and was elevated to super-stardom. With it, came drugs, alcohol, arrests, and crazy spending sprees. Now he&#39;s sober and a Hollywood pariah, washed up at twenty-four.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To revamp his image, Chase&#39;s publicist comes up with a plan: surprise Amanda Grace with the chance to meet her hero, followed by a visit to the set of Chase&#39;s new movie. The meeting is a disaster, but out of mutual desperation, Amanda and Chase strike a deal. What starts as a simple arrangement, though, rapidly becomes more complicated when they realize they need each other in more ways than one. But when the past resurfaces in a new threat, will they stand together or fall apart?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With charm and heart, Stacey Kade takes readers on a journey of redemption and love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
