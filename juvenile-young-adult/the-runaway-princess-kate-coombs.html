  <title>The Runaway Princess - Kate Coombs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;A dragon darkens our dells. A witch haunts our woods. Bandits roam our moors&quot; . . . King Stromgard swept on. &quot;In the tradition of so many monarchs, I offer my daughter&#39;s hand in marriage and half my kingdom to the prince who can rid us of these evils, restoring peace and prosperity to our realm.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so the contest in the Kingdom of Greeve begins. But Princess Margaret is not your traditional princess. Meg firmly objects to her parents&#39; giving her away, and she certainly has no intention of remaining in the tower where she is sequestered. Instead, she sets out to win the contest herself by enlisting the help of her good friend, her loyal maid, an eager guardsman, a young wizard, and a tenacious witch. Does Meg find her distinct place in the kingdom, or is she doomed to fulfill her royal duties?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kate Coombs weaves a magical tale full of pesky princes, enchanted frogs, a beady-eyed scarf, and invisibility juice - a tale of wonder, but a story familiar to all who struggle to find their own place in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Runaway Princess&lt;/i&gt; is a 2007 Bank Street - Best Children&#39;s Book of the Year.&lt;/p&gt;" />
