  <title>Domestic Arrangements - Norma Klein, Judy Blume</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Originally published in 1982, &lt;i&gt;Domestic Arrangements&lt;/i&gt; is the story of a fourteen-year-old New York teen named Tatiana, an unintentional ing&amp;#233;nue who becomes notorious for filming a nude scene for a major movie. Tatiana&#39;s newfound fame&amp;#8212;which includes interviews, magazine covers, and publicists&amp;#8212;is set against the backdrop of an increasingly adult personal life, as her parents file for divorce, her sister becomes increasingly jealous of her sibling&#39;s success, and she finally chooses between an old boyfriend and new, older loves. A stunning example of Norma Klein&#39;s fearless take on the complexities of adolescence, &lt;i&gt;Domestic Arrangements&lt;/i&gt; is an indelible portrait of a girl on the cusp of adulthood, learning to balance the challenges of life in the spotlight with love, family, and friendship. This edition features a brand new introduction by Norma&#39;s long-time friend, renowned children&#39;s author Judy Blume.&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Norma Klein&lt;/b&gt; was best known for young adult works that dealt with family problems, childhood and adolescent sexuality, as well as social issues like racism, sexism, and contraception. Her first novel, &lt;i&gt;Mom, the Wolf Man and Me&lt;/i&gt; (1972), was about the daughter of an unmarried, sexually active woman. Her subsequent works included &lt;i&gt;Sunshine&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;It&#39;s Okay If You Don&#39;t Love Me&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Breaking Up&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Family Secrets&lt;/i&gt;. Because of their subject matter, many of her books sparked considerable controversy, and a 1986 American Library Association survey found that nine of her novels had been removed from libraries. In an interview that same year with the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;, Klein said: &#39;I&#39;m not a rebel, trying to stir things up just to be provocative. I&#39;m doing it because I feel like writing about real life.&#39; She died in 1989 at the age of fifty.&lt;/div&gt;" />
