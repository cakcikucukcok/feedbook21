  <title>Tell the Story to Its End - Simon P. Clark</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;Tell the story to its end,&quot; says Eren with a grin.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;His yellow eyes are glowing like embers in the night.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;When I reach the end,&quot; I say, &quot;what happens? You&#39;ll have the whole story.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;Hmm,&quot; he says, looking at me and licking his lips with a dry, grey tongue. &quot;What happens then? Why don&#39;t we find out?&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People are keeping secrets from Oli. His mum has brought him to stay with his aunt and uncle in the countryside, but nobody will tell him why his dad isn&#39;t there, too. Why hasn&#39;t he come with them? Has something happened? Why won&#39;t anyone talk about it? Oli has a hundred questions, and only an old, empty house in the middle of an ancient forest for answers. But then he finds a secret of his own: there is a creature that lives in the attic...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eren is not human.&lt;br&gt;Eren is hungry for stories.&lt;br&gt;Eren has been waiting for him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Eren to listen, Oli starts to make sense of what&#39;s happening. But Eren is powerful, and though he&#39;s willing to help Oli, he&#39;s not willing to do it for free; he wants something in return. Oli must make a choice: he can learn the truth -- but to do so he must abandon himself to Eren&#39;s world, forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From striking new voice Simon P. Clark comes &lt;i&gt;Tell the Story to Its End&lt;/i&gt;; richly atmospheric, moving, unsettling, and told in gorgeous prose, it is a modern classic in the making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-----&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Sure-footed, distinctive, strange, poetic. Simon P. Clark is a truly interesting new voice.&quot;--David Almond, award-winning author of &lt;i&gt;Skellig&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Unflinchingly dark and unforgettably creepy, &lt;i&gt;Tell the Story to Its End&lt;/i&gt; will have you in its grip.&quot;--Anne Ursu, award-winning author of &lt;i&gt;The Real Boy&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Shadow Thieves&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Offering a spiral of stories within stories, this atmospheric first novel features a boy searching for truth, who gets sidetracked by a remarkable discovery. Echoing the surreal quality and settings of David Almond&#39;s books, this novel adeptly mixes fantasy with reality and leaves some pressing questions unanswered.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Debut British-American author Clark creates a tale with mythic largesse...The book explores the relationship between truth and fiction, the essence of story, and the urgency of putting dreams and experiences into words &#39;to fire imaginations and break worlds.&#39; Savvy readers and would-be writers will love this exploration of story as an art form, a panacea, and an endless part of life.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;Kirkus Reviews&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The magical realism and storytelling details will draw fantasy readers, who will find meaty substance and enough Britishisms to lend flavor. While the conclusion is entirely logical, it&#39;s unexpected and will spark discussion, challenging readers to reflect on the nature of both stories and reality.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;Booklist&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Eren has echoes of&lt;i&gt; A Monster Calls&lt;/i&gt; by Patrick Ness or &lt;i&gt;Skellig &lt;/i&gt;by David Almond.
