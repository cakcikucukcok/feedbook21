  <title>FAIRY TALES FROM MANY LANDS - One of the most read children&#39;s book of all time - Anon E. Mouse, Compiled and Illustrated by Katharine Pyle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;ldquo;FAIRY TALES FROM MANY LANDS&amp;rdquo; is one of the all-time children&amp;rsquo;s classics. Between 1911 and 1938 it was reprinted on no less than 7 occasions &amp;ndash; a record for a children&amp;rsquo;s book.&lt;br /&gt;
Like the Grimm Bros. and Andrew Lang before her, Katherine Pyle has collected 15 stories from around the world, then edited and illustrated them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Herein you will find the stories of:&lt;br /&gt;
The Seven Golden Peahens&lt;br /&gt;
Mishosha, The Magician Of The Lake&lt;br /&gt;
Haamdaanee And The Wise Gazelle&lt;br /&gt;
The Two Sisters&lt;br /&gt;
The Feather Of The Zhar Bird&lt;br /&gt;
The Beautiful Maria Di Legno&lt;br /&gt;
The Evil One Who Married Three Sisters&lt;br /&gt;
The Faithful Dog&lt;br /&gt;
Kempion&lt;br /&gt;
Buttercup&lt;br /&gt;
The Sun And The Moon&lt;br /&gt;
How The Elephant And The Whale Were Tricked&lt;br /&gt;
Cherry&lt;br /&gt;
Diamonds And Roses And Pearls; and&lt;br /&gt;
The Three Cows&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These are not the usual fare of fairy tales, which was why the book has been so successful. Here are tales from Serbia, the American Indians, the spice island of Zanzibar, the Hindus of India, the Cossacks, the Romans, Norse, Italian, Turkish and more besides.&lt;br /&gt;
So sit back with a steamy beverage and be prepared to be entertained for many-an-hour with this series of forgotten children&amp;rsquo;s stories. If and when you come to pick up the book where you left it, don&amp;rsquo;t be surprised if you find a younger reader is now engrossed in these stories and is somewhat reluctant to let it go.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
10% of the net sale will be donated to charities by the publisher.&lt;br /&gt;
