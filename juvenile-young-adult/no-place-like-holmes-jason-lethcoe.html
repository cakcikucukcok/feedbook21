  <title>No Place Like Holmes - Jason Lethcoe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Think &lt;i&gt;Treasure Island&lt;/i&gt;’s Jim Hawkins and Encyclopedia Brown rolled into one adventurous, ingenious, God-fearing lad, and you get the idea. Fun, suspenseful, and unpredictable, the No Place Like Holmes books are fantastic reads, and author Jason Lethcoe is a fine craftsman of words to boot. I highly recommend this series.” —Robert Liparulo, bestselling author of Dreamhouse Kings and &lt;i&gt;The 13th Tribe&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The new resident in 221A Baker Street&amp;nbsp;is about to give Sherlock Holmes a run for his magnifying glass!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When Griffin is sent to stay with his detective uncle at 221A Baker Street for the summer, he is certain that his uncle must be the great Sherlock Holmes! But Griffin is disappointed to discover that Holmes lives at 221B Baker Street&amp;nbsp;and his uncle lives unit 221A. His uncle is a detective, just not a very good one. But when Griffin meets a woman with a case that Holmes has turned away for being too ridiculous, he and his uncle team up to help her. Along the way, Griffin shows his uncle just what it means to have true faith in God, even when the case challenges that.&amp;nbsp; The woman claims that her husband was eaten by the Loch Ness Monster, but monsters aren’t real—or are they? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The No Place Like Holmes books will capture you on first page and not let you go until the final fascinating twist and turn. Jason Lethcoe is an excellent writer with the ability to craft a story that entertains all readers (adults are welcome to take a peek!).” —Robert Whitlow, bestselling author of the Tides of Truth series&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meets national education standards.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
