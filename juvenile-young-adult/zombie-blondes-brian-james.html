A lot of houses were for sale, and the town seemed infected by an unearthly quiet. And then, on Hannah&#39;s first day of classes, she ran into a group of cheerleaders -- the most popular girls in school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The odd thing was that they were nearly identical in appearance: blonde, beautiful, and deathly pale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Hannah wants desperately to fit in -- regardless of what her friend Lukas is telling her: If she doesn&#39;t watch her back, she&#39;s going to be blonde and popular and dead -- just like all the other zombies in this town. . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This foray into the world of the living dead is suspenseful and downright terrifying, with an ending right out of a classic film.&quot; -- &lt;i&gt;Kirkus Reviews&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
