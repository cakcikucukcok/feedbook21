  	<div class="indent justify" style="visibility:hidden"><b><i>Remember Yesterday - Pintip Dunn</i></b> | Remember Yesterday is the next instalment in the Forget Tomorrow series by Pintip Dunn. I liked the first book and after that horrific ending I was excited to get stuck into the next book. However, I felt an immediate disconnect when I opened my Kindle to discover this book was narrated by Jessa ten years later.<br /><b><i>Remember Yesterday (Forget Tomorrow, #2) by Pintip Dunn</i></b> | Remember Yesterday is so good! I was hooked to the pages. It was a thrilling ride that I didn't want to end. Pintip Dunn has created an amazing world building it with multidimensional characters. I love the action, the suspense and the romance in this novel. It had everything I want in a fantasy world. Jessa was an extraordinary young girl.<br /><b><i>Amazon.com: Remember Yesterday (Forget Tomorrow ...</i></b> | Pintip is represented by literary agent Beth Miller of Writers House. Her debut novel, FORGET TOMORROW, won the RWA RITAÂ® for Best First Book. Her other novels include THE DARKEST LIE and REMEMBER YESTERDAY. She lives with her husband and children in Maryland.
