  	<div class="indent justify" style="visibility:hidden"><b><i>Grit - Gillian French</i></b> | Wow! Grit is a story most people want to sweep under the rug. Kudos to Gillian French for writing about it. There are many things going on in this novel but the underling issue is still in the forefront. Darcy is the main character who you can't help but love. She is who she is and she owns it.<br /><b><i>Grit by Gillian French - Goodreads</i></b> | Gillian French has a gift for setting scenes with very specific, vivid details. The summery rural Maine existence MC Darcy experiences is almost palpable. 3. Girl bonds. Darcy’s closest friends are her older sister, Mags, and her beautiful cousin, Nell, and I thought the depiction of the girls’ complex trio was very well done. They bicker ...<br /><b><i>Amazon.com: Grit: A Novel (9780062642554): French, Gillian ...</i></b> | Gillian French’s debut novel, Grit, was an Indie Next List pick and received starred reviews from Kirkus Reviews and ALA Booklist. She holds a BA in English from the University of Maine and lives in Hermon, Maine, with her husband and sons.
