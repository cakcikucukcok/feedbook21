  <title>Secrets of Tamarind - Nadia Aguiar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s been four years since Maya, Simon, and Penny Nelson left the lost island of Tamarind. For Maya, the island is a nearly forgotten part of her childhood; for Penny, it&#39;s a secret place she can&#39;t remember, but longs to see; and for Simon, it&#39;s an adventure waiting to happen. An evil group called the Red Coral Project is lurking around the Nelson&#39;s home in Bermuda, and the children discover that the project has moved into Tamarind, and are desiccating it to ruin. Only the Nelson&#39;s can save the island.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Tamarind, there is the mystery of the magical mineral ophalla that Red Coral is greedily mining, their old pirate ship, the Pamela Jane, and the secret of their friend Helix&#39;s parentage. This time, it is up to Simon to put the clues together, and save his sisters from the island and the nefarious Red Coral Project--and defeat Red Coral before the magnificent island is put to ruin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nadia Aguiar&#39;s sequel to The Lost Island of Tamarind, crafts a vivid story reminiscent of such classics as Peter Pan, full of adventure, magic, and haunting beauty.&lt;/p&gt;" />
