  <title>Early to Death, Early to Rise - Kim Harrison</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seventeen, dead, and in charge of heaven&#39;s dark angels&amp;#8212;all itching to kill someone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Madison Avery&#39;s dreams of ever fitting in at her new school died when &lt;em&gt;she&lt;/em&gt; did. Especially since she was able to maintain the illusion of a body, deal with a pesky guardian angel, and oh yeah, bring the reaper who killed her to &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; untimely end. Not exactly in-crowd material. It&#39;s amazing that her crush, Josh, doesn&#39;t think she&#39;s totally nuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now Madison has learned that she&#39;s the dark timekeeper, in charge of angels who follow the murky guidelines of fate. Never one to abide by the rules, she decides it&#39;s time for a major change to the system. With the help of some unlikely allies, Madison forms a rogue group of reapers who definitely don&#39;t adhere to the rules of the heavens. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as she grapples with the terrifying new skills that come with being a timekeeper, Madison realizes she may not be prepared for what lies ahead&amp;#8212;unless she gets some seriously divine intervention.&lt;/p&gt;" />
