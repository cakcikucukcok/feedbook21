  <title>Once Upon a Time in Venice - Monique Roy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;An intriguing, middle-grade chapter book that takes young readers, ages 9-12, on a physical and emotional journey to Venice, Italy.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This enchanting story revolves around the relationship between Samuelle, a young boy, and his grandfather Leo. Leo has learned that he suffers from a terminal illness, and in his wistful skimming of artifacts from the past, he uncovers treasured mementos of his earliest years growing up in the romantic city of Venice. Sharing them with Samuelle, he infects the boy with an infatuation for the city, one they will both share when Leo decides to accept an invitation to participate in the annual Regatta, a rowing festival that his own great-grandfather had competed in with great success.  The two embark on their journey without Samuelle knowing about Leo&#39;s illness, but Leo makes a promise to himself that it is in Venice, after he has passed on his knowledge and fondness for the city to his grandson, that he will reveal the truth about his fate. Venice becomes a special place in their hearts forever.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This beautiful, middle-grade chapter book will show young readers, ages 9-12, the strong impact and importance of family, love, and the community in our lives. Read this preteen book with your kids, grandchildren, nieces or nephews, and you will be instantly transported to the romantic city of Venice, Italy! The vivid descriptions of Venice enliven the story. From the food and the architecture to the art and the magical canals, you are right there in Venice, without the long flight and the icky airplane food! All adventurers wanted: preteen readers are taken on an emotional journey that is educational, sad, sweet and heartwarming, and opens their eyes to geography and cultures.&lt;/P&gt;" />
