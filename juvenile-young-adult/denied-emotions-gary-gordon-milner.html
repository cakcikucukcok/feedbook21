  <title>Denied Emotions - Gary Gordon Milner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Denied Emotions and addictions go hand and hand
Jack lost his family due to his addictions. He did not know how to get in touch with his emotions, to bring them out so that he could deal with them. His son Tommy had to grow up without a father and suffered many hardships before he learned to get in touch with his emotions so that he could move on in life.
Jacks wife Sarah had to learn to raise her son by herself and she could not understand why her husband had made the wrong choices by leaving them all alone in life to fend for themselves. After ten years Sarah decided to take the wall down and try to trust again.
Jack went through many struggles with alcohol, cocaine and prescription morphine. Due to alcohol a tragedy at work landed him in the hospital with broken bones and Jack still could not learn. He had to go through more pain and grief before he woke up and realized that he was causing his own problems. Only when he was almost arrested and thrown into jail for the possession of a narcotic with the intent to distribute did he start to think of his new daughter Shyanna, what would happen to her without him in her life. He already had one child that had to grow up without a father and Jack was determined to turn this around, get in touch with his emotions and be there for her.
*Many addicts who cannot get in touch with their emotions will never have that burning desire to heal and move on. To lose the love of your family because you choose to make the wrong choices in life is the most painful part of life that I had ever suffered. Three years ago I finally made the right choices in life so that I too could move on.*" />
