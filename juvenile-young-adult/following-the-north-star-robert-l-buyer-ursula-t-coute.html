  <title>Following the North Star - Robert L. Buyer, Ursula T. Coute</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Its 1947, and George has just graduated from high school in Maine. He wants to find a job that will be physically challenging and spiritually rewarding, and hes always admired the local loggers who put their heart and soul into their work. Unfortunately, there are no available jobs in Maine, so George accepts a position at a logging camp in Oregon, thousands of miles from home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;George enjoys the strenuous new job and realizes that by providing lumber, he is contributing to society, even if its in a small way. He makes friends with Jacob, a fellow logger and amateur astronomer, and together they study nature and begin to reconsider their values in life. Then tragedy strikes; Jacob has an accident and ends up in the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When George visits Jacob in the hospital, hes impressed by the medical staffs love and skill. They are truly making a difference in peoples lives. Could he do the same? With prayer and deep consideration, George decides that he, too, wants to have the same type of role, and he determines to go to medical school after he is done with his term at the logging camp. But lots of obstacles stand in Georges way, and he must look to God for direction. Will he be able to reach for his dreams?&lt;/p&gt;" />
