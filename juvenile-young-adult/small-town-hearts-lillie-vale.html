  <title>Small Town Hearts - Lillie Vale</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Fresh out of high school, Babe Vogel should be thrilled to have the whole summer at her fingertips. She loves living in her lighthouse home in the sleepy Maine beach town of Oar&#39;s Rest and being a barista at the Busy Bean, but she&#39;s totally freaking out about how her life will change when her two best friends go to college in the fall. And when a reckless kiss causes all three of them to break up, she may lose them a lot sooner. On top of that, her ex-girlfriend is back in town, bringing with her a slew of memories, both good and bad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then there&#39;s Levi Keller, the cute artist who&#39;s spending all his free time at the coffee shop where she works. Levi&#39;s from out of town, and even though Babe knows better than to fall for a tourist who will leave when summer ends, she can&#39;t stop herself from wanting to know him. Can Babe keep her distance, or will she break the one rule she&#39;s always had - to never fall for a summer boy?&lt;/p&gt;" />
