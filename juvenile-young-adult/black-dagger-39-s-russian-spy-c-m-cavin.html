  <title>Black Dagger&#39;s Russian Spy - C.M. Cavin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;I&gt;Black Dagger&#39;s Russian Spy&lt;/I&gt; is about a sixteen-year-old high school student named Valric who&#39;s parents support him when he gets accepted into Black Dagger&#39;s School for Spies and Secret Agents. The school lasts five years, though even in an unusual school Valric has some unusual adventures. He has to deal with a Russian spy that only he and his friends can stop while he deals with new friendships, a new girlfriend, school grades, and his new skydiving team. His first year at the school is more eventful than most spies have in a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
When his friends turn against him because backs are being stabbed, he still has to help the school. The question remains: Can Valric deal with the pressure? Or must he go back to high school as a normal kid?&lt;/p&gt;" />
