  <title>Seven Sisters - Carolyn Hart Bennett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The early Mormon Church was forced out of several states and finally blazed a trail across unknown territory to Utah to form their own theocracy.  In addition to this westward movement, converts in Europe were admonished to &quot;gather to Zion&quot; and build up the Church in the Salt Lake Valley.&lt;p&gt;
85,000  Mormon emigrants came to America by sailing ships between the years of 1840 and 1890.  Seven Sisters takes place on one of these ships--the Amazon.&lt;p&gt;  
Carrying 800 Latter-day Saints, it had a send off from Charles Dickens at the London Docks and landed in New York City a couple of days after the deadliest riot in American History-the Draft Riots of 1863.&lt;p&gt; 
During the 44 day crossing, there are births, deaths, storms, sea-sickness, accidents, drama, humor, romance, and pure religion.&lt;p&gt;
All of this is seen through the eyes of seven single young women who start out the voyage individually and are soon placed together as a &quot;family&quot; by Church leaders.  Although, they aren&#39;t related as such, they are &quot;sisters&quot; in the Gospel, and together they face the adventures, hardships, and dangers of an ocean voyage.&lt;p&gt;" />
