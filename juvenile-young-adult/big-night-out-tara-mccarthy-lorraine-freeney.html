  <title>Big Night Out - Tara McCarthy, Lorraine Freeney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Like the wildly popular Choose Your Own Adventure tales of our childhood--only with a 20-something twist--&lt;i&gt;Big Night Out&lt;/i&gt; is the kind of book readers will delve into more than once in their sometimes frustrating, sometimes victorious, pursuit of their quest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In&lt;i&gt; Big Night Out&lt;/i&gt; you must meet up with your current love interest at a party. In order to get to this party, you must track down one of a number of friends who were actually invited and figure out a way to tag along. Some friends are more cooperative than others; after all, each of them has an agenda of his or her own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Likewise, the city you live in poses its own challenges; you may encounter pick-pockets, insane taxi drivers, difficult bouncers, and a full cast of &quot;extras.&quot; Add to that the practical necessities such as securing food lest you pass out from drinking too much, and&lt;i&gt; Big Night Out&lt;/i&gt; could end up being a night out on the town from hell--depending on what you, the reader, choose to do at every turn.&lt;/p&gt;" />
