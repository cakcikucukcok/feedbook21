  <title>The Nutcracker of Nuremberg - Illustrated with Silhouettes Cut by Else Hasselriis - Alexandre Dumas, Else Hasselris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Based on the classic Christmas story by E. T. A. Hoffmann, The Nutcracker of Nuremberg is the magical adventure of Marie Stahlbaum&#39;s favourite toy, the Nutcracker, who battles the nefarious Mouse King in battle and takes the reader on a wonderful adventure, into a magical land of dolls. Dumas&#39;s version was adapted by the Russian composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky into the famous ballet The Nutcracker. Contents include: Part I: The Story of the Nutcracker of Nuremburg, Part II: The Story of the Nut Krakatuk and the Princess Pirlipate, and Part III: The Story of Marie and the King of the Toys.  This wonderful story is accompanied by the beautiful silhouettes cut by Else Hasselriis. This book forms part of our &#39;Pook Press&#39; imprint, celebrating the golden age of illustration in children&#39;s literature.  Alexandre Dumas (1802-1870) was a famous French writer. He is best remembered for his exciting romantic sagas, including The Three Musketeers and The Count of Monte Cristo. Despite making a great deal of money from his writing, Dumas was almost perpetually penniless thanks to his extravagant lifestyle. His novels have since been translated into nearly a hundred different languages, and have inspired over two hundred motion pictures." />
