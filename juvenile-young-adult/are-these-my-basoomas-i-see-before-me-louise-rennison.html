  <title>Are These My Basoomas I See Before Me? - Louise Rennison</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For Georgia, the more things change, the more they stay the same. Just when she thought she was the official one-and-only girlfriend of Masimo, he&#39;s walked off into the night with the full hump, leaving Georgia all aloney on her owney-again. All because Dave the Laugh tried to do fisticuffs at dawn with him! Two boys fighting over Georgia? It&#39;s almost as romantic as Romeo and Juliet . . . though perhaps a touch less tragic. It&#39;s time for Georgia to get to the bottom (oo-er) of this Dave the Laugh spontaneous puckering business once and for all. It&#39;s like they always say: If you snog a mate in the forest of red bottomosity and no one is around to see it, is he still a mate? Or is he something more?&lt;/p?" />
