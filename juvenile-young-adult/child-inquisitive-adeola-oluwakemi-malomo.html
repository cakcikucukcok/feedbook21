  <title>Child Inquisitive - Adeola Oluwakemi Malomo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There is a hunger in every child to know more, and parents, Sunday school teachers, grandparents, uncles and aunts, etc. can play a very important and effective role in supporting the spiritual growth and development of the 21st century Christian child. 
Often times, we are scared by their questions as they reveal a depth that is only common with people of age. It makes us wonder what goes on in their little minds and how on earth they conceive the questions that pop out of their adorable mouths. At other times, we find their inquisitiveness downright irritating! More so, when we have no ready answers to questions that we feel we should have thought about ourselves and had answers to. 
On the other hand, when we neglect to pay attention to this aspect of their nature, they will find the answers themselves through friends, books, the media, etc. and this could have an unfortunate but lasting effect on their lives and on their relationship with God. 
Proverb 22:6 offers another opportunity to bring children closer to God. It charges the custodians of children as follows: Train up a child in the way he should go and when he is old, he will not depart from it." />
