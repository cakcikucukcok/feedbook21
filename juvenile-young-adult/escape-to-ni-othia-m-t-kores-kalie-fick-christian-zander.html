  <title>Escape to Niñothia - M.T. Kores, Kalie Fick, Christian Zander</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Shia Bachman longs for the day when he&amp;rsquo;s old enough to leave his &amp;ldquo;home&amp;rdquo;. Smiles Orphanage is run by Olga, the meanest woman you&amp;rsquo;ll ever come across. Between cooking meals, cleaning, fixing the old house, and working for Mr. Heinmeyer, Shia barely has time for anything else in his life. That is, until one fall day&amp;hellip;..&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Some of the younger children from the orphanage bring home an old book about a magical land where all animals are tame, children are always happy, and there are no grumpy adults! While fighting over the book, a map falls from the binding, instructing the way to the exquisite land called &amp;ldquo;Ni&amp;ntilde;othia&amp;rdquo;. Mystified and excited, Shia and the rest of the children at the orphanage decide to escape in hopes of finding this place. During their journey though, they begin encountering many obstacles and it starts to feel as if they may never make it to this magical land&amp;hellip;..which might very well be just a fairytale.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;M.T. Kores&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Escape to Ni&amp;ntilde;othia &lt;/em&gt;tells the story of a group of mistreated orphans and their voyage to a fairytale land they believe actually exists. During their expedition, they learn to put their trust in each other, care for one another, and experience what it means to be part of a team that works together. Filled with nature, mystery, excitement, wonder, and imagination, this magical story will have readers on the edge of their seats until the very end.&lt;/p&gt;" />
