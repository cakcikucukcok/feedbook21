  <title>TEZCATLIPOCA AND THE TOLTECS - A Toltec Legend from Ancient Anahuac - Anon E. Mouse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 392&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In this 392nd issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;series, Baba Indaba narrates the Toltec Fairy Tale of &amp;quot;TEZCATLIPOCA AND THE TOLTECS&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A long, long time ago in the land of Anahuac, in the days of Quetzalcoatl there was abundance of everything necessary for subsistence. The maize was plentiful, the calabashes were as thick as one&amp;rsquo;s arm, and cotton grew in all colours without having to be dyed.&lt;br /&gt;
But this blissful state was too fortunate to last. Envious of the calm enjoyment of the god and his people the Toltecs, three wicked &amp;ldquo;necromancers&amp;rdquo; plotted their downfall and these wicked necromancers invaded the Nahua tribes. The deities Huitzilopochtli, Titlacahuan or Tezcatlipoca laid evil enchantments upon the city of Tollan, and Tezcatlipoca in particular took the lead in these envious conspiracies.&lt;br /&gt;
Disguised as an aged man with white hair, he presented himself at the palace of Quetzalcoatl, where he request an audience with Quetzalcoatl.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The pages refused this and showed him out. advised him to retire, as Quetzalcoatl was indisposed and could see no one. He requested them, however, to tell the god Tezcatlipoca was waiting outside and he was granted admittance.&lt;br /&gt;
On entering the king&amp;rsquo;s chamber, the wily Tezcatlipoca simulated much sympathy with the suffering god-king. &amp;ldquo;How are you, my son?&amp;rdquo; he asked. &amp;ldquo;I have brought you a drug which you should drink, and which will put an end to the course of your malady.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You are welcome, old man,&amp;rdquo; replied Quetzalcoatl for he had been suffering and had been indisposed for quite a while. Tezcatlipoca assured him that if he partook of the medicine, he would immediately experience a great improvement in health. Quetzalcoatl drank the potion, and at once felt much revived. The cunning Tezcatlipoca pressed another and still another cup of the potion upon him, and as it was nothing but the wine of the country, and the King speedily became intoxicated.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What happened next you ask&amp;hellip;? Was the King &amp;nbsp;totally overcome by the evil machinations or did he succeed in breaking free of Tezcatlipoca&amp;rsquo;s hold over him? And what of the people and the country? Well many things happened, some silly and some serious. To find the answers to these questions, and others you may have, you will have to download and read this story to find out for yourself!&lt;br /&gt;
