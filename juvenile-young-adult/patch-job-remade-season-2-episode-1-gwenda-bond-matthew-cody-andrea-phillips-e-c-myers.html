  <title>Patch Job (ReMade Season 2 Episode 1) - Gwenda Bond, Matthew Cody, Andrea Phillips, E. C. Myers...</title>
      <meta name="description" content="You live. You love. You die. Now RUN.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the 1st episode in the second season of &lt;i&gt;ReMade&lt;/i&gt;, a 14-episode serial from Serial Box Publishing. This episode was written by Andrea Phillips. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A figure from the group’s past reappears, bringing up some serious questions about their remade lives. Is anything they thought they knew true? Can caretakers ever be &lt;i&gt;good&lt;/i&gt;? And, most important, who can they trust?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One moment proved fateful for a group of teenagers—and not just because it’s the moment they all happened to die. At the moment of their deaths, they were snatched forward into the future and remade in a world they hardly recognize. Now, after facing murderous robots and an unpredictable environment, the teens have begun to find their footing. But can they survive long enough to figure out why they were remade? And will they ever be able to stop running?" />
