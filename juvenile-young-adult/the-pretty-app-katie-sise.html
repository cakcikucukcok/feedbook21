  <title>The Pretty App - Katie Sise</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The delightfully smart and funny companion to &lt;em&gt;The Boyfriend App&lt;/em&gt;, about a mean girl who changes her ways.

She&#39;s rich, she&#39;s gorgeous, and she&#39;s the queen bee of Harrison High. But it turns out Blake&#39;s life is not so perfect&amp;#8212;just talk to her dad, who constantly reminds her that she&#39;s not up to par, or to her ex-bff, Audrey, who doesn&#39;t even look her in the eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then every high school in America becomes obsessed with posting selfies on the ubiquitous Pretty App. Next: Leo, an adorable transfer student, arrives at Harrison and begins to show Blake that maybe being a queen bee doesn&#39;t mean being a queen b*tch.

She&#39;s whisked away to star in a reality show&amp;#8212;in Hollywood, on live TV. But she doesn&#39;t know who to trust. Because everybody on the show wants to win. And nobody is there to make friends.&lt;/p&gt;" />
