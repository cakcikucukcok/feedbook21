  <title>Street Song - Sheena Wilkinson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ryan&#39;s career is over. After winning a TV talent show and becoming a teen sensation, his fame has spiralled into addiction, embarrassing headlines and career suicide. Now his image-obsessed stepdad wants him at home, back in school and under his thumb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, a chance meeting with the enigmatic Toni offers him a fresh start in a new city. Before long he has reinvented himself, made real friends and is playing real music in Toni&#39;s band. Despite living in a hostel, busking for his wages and living under a false identity, Ryan is finally happy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But struggling to exist on the brink of homelessness, he is exposed to a more sinister world. Forced to truly decide what kind of person he wants to be, Ryan begins to realise that starting over comes at a price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&#39;This story rings with truth - a book to fall in love with&#39;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;Keren David&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&#39;I couldn&#39;t put this book down&#39;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cat Clarke&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&#39;Played on my heartstrings.
