  <title>Alex As Well - Alyssa Brugman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Alex is ready for things to change, in a big way. Everyone seems to think she&#39;s a boy, but for Alex the whole boy/girl thing isn&#39;t as simple as either/or, and when she decides girl is closer to the truth, no one knows how to react, least of all her parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Undeterred, Alex begins to create a new identity for herself: ditching one school, enrolling in another, and throwing out most of her clothes. But the other Alex-the boy Alex-has a lot to say about that. Heartbreaking and droll in equal measures, &lt;i&gt;Alex As Well &lt;/i&gt;is a brilliantly told story of exploring gender and sexuality, navigating friendships, and finding a place to belong.&lt;/p&gt;" />
