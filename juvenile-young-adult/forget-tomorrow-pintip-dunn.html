  <title>Forget Tomorrow - Pintip Dunn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Now a New York Times bestseller!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Imagine a world where your destiny has already been decided...by your future self. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&#39;s Callie&#39;s seventeenth birthday and, like everyone else, she&#39;s eagerly awaiting her vision--a memory sent back in time to sculpt each citizen into the person they&#39;re meant to be. A world-class swimmer. A renowned scientist.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Or in Callie&#39;s case, a criminal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In her vision, she sees herself murdering her gifted younger sister. Before she can process what it means, Callie is arrested and placed in prison. The only person who can help is her childhood crush, Logan, a boy she hasn&#39;t spoken to in five years. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Logan breaks her free, but can she trust him? He&#39;s &lt;i&gt;almost&lt;/i&gt; the same boy she remembers, but now he&#39;s a whole lot hotter. And he&#39;s got his own past to deal with. Callie&#39;s falling for him, fast, but she soon learns he has secrets of his own. Secrets that mean they can never be together. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, Callie&#39;s on the run not only from the government, but also from her fate. If she wants any hope of a future with Logan, she must first find a way to protect her sister from the biggest threat of all--herself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;This book is enhanced with exclusive content--two original songs inspired by the novel--resulting in a large file that may take longer to download than expected.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;The Forget Tomorrow series is best enjoyed in order.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reading Order:&lt;br&gt;Before Tomorrow (Prequel)&lt;br&gt;Book #1 Forget Tomorrow&lt;br&gt;Book #2 Remember Yesterday&lt;br&gt;Book #3 Seize Today&lt;/p&gt;" />
