  <title>The Eleventh Trade - Alyssa Hollingsworth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From debut author Alyssa Hollingsworth comes a story about living with fear, being a friend, and finding a new place to call home.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;They say you can&#39;t get something for nothing, but nothing is all Sami has. When his grandfather&#39;s most-prized possession--a traditional Afghan instrument called a rebab--is stolen, Sami resolves to get it back. He finds it at a music store, but it costs $700, and Sami doesn&#39;t have even one penny. What he does have is a keychain that has caught the eye of his classmate. If he trades the keychain for something more valuable, could he keep trading until he has $700? Sami is about to find out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Eleventh Trade&lt;/i&gt; is both a classic middle school story and a story about being a refugee. Alyssa Hollingsworth tackles a big issue with a light touch.&lt;/p&gt;" />
