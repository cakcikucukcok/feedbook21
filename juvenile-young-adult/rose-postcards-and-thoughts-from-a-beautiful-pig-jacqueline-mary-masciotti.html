  <title>Rose - Postcards and Thoughts from a Beautiful Pig - Jacqueline Mary Masciotti</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book was written by the author to touch on the contentious and sensitive adversity aspects of issues relating to - burdens and tribulations, against - weaknesses and strengths - of hidden love in silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It reflects upon the blamelessness of others from a truly beloved love that, no one can share except a lonely pig that is forbidden to communicate in the outside of her pen, that she lives in and, becomes a great friend and loved animal pig - and of course be accepted by human society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author holds back nothing that can cause destructive and negative associations between animal and human relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am sure you will be able to relate to this tale - as it is based on true research facts and experiences throughout the period of this beloved pig  she is called &lt;strong&gt;ROSE&lt;/strong&gt;  because that is a beautiful name for a pig  who in nature is a very intelligent pig, with an expansive imagination  you can get locked up so easily in her adventures and beliefs. She also has a most sensitive nature and wants so desperately to be adored, respected and loved by other pig pals and family connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ROSE&lt;/strong&gt; can be viewed at anytime in your heart with her imagination going wild - she is the most beautiful pig in the world and, can be reached in any parts of anyones imagination  because she has tried so hard to fly in any direction that catches her spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, at the beginning of her life she was a very lonely pig until she meets another pig pal friend who did not have a name, but &lt;strong&gt;ROSE &lt;/strong&gt;called him &lt;strong&gt;CESAR, &lt;/strong&gt;because he believed in her beauty and imagination and, they can both fly together in harmony one day. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ROSE and CESAR replies to all readers of this book to love, respect and give happiness to these pig animals and of course all animals in this world for today and tomorrow.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
