  <title>Ms. Bixby&#39;s Last Day - John David Anderson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&amp;#160;funny, heartwarming, and heartbreaking contemporary story about three boys, one teacher, and a day none of them will ever forget.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone knows there are different kinds of teachers. The boring ones, the mean ones, the ones who try too hard, the ones who stopped trying long ago. The ones you&amp;#8217;ll never remember, and the ones you want to forget. Ms. Bixby is none of these. She&amp;#8217;s the sort of teacher who makes you feel like school is somehow worthwhile. Who recognizes something in you that sometimes you don&amp;#8217;t even see in yourself. Who you never want to disappoint. What Ms. Bixby is, is one of a kind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Topher, Brand, and Steve know this better than anyone. And so when Ms. Bixby unexpectedly announces that she won&amp;#8217;t be able to finish the school year, they come up with a risky plan&amp;#8212;more of a quest, really&amp;#8212;to give Ms. Bixby the last day she deserves. Through the three very different stories they tell, we begin to understand what Ms. Bixby means to each of them&amp;#8212;and what the three of them mean to each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John David Anderson is the author of &lt;em&gt;Sidekicked &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;The Dungeoneers&lt;/em&gt;, proven winners with middle grade readers, and &lt;em&gt;Ms. Bixby&#39;s D&lt;/em&gt;ay is no exception.&lt;/p&gt;" />
