      <meta name="description" content="Moody&#39;s Island, set like a jewel in Nine-Mile Marsh, is a valuable piece of property. When the widow who owns it dies and leaves the island to an absolute stranger, everybody wonders why. There is still one living relative, Clyde Moody, who was not even mentioned in the widow&#39;s will. Public opinion runs high in Clyde&#39;s favor, especially when incriminating rumors and evidence begins to mount against the new owner of the island who, after all, is not even a local Maine resident.&lt;P&gt;
Lucille and Brent Pierce, young people who live nearby, become intrigued with this mysterious situation. Just as they begin to know and like their new neighbor, they make a terrifying discovery on Moody&#39;s Island. Could Clyde Moody be plotting against their friend, or have they accepted and trusted a probable criminal?&lt;P&gt;
In this classic mystery by Mary C. Jane the young reader is again plunged into moments of suspense and anxiety as he races from one exciting chapter to the next. As in all of Mrs. Jane&#39;s books, the pace never flags.&quot;" />
