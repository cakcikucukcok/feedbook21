  <title>Josie Unlimited - Stephen Shifflett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="An awkward but handsome fifteen-year-old, Donnie Darning has a brilliant mind but a dysfunctional family. His father is overbearing, and his mother drowns her problems in alcohol. Fortunately, his dismal world doesn&#39;t compare to the vast universe he finds inside books, but he is tired of living life vicariously through reading stories.&lt;p&gt; 
Josie Rosado changes all that. Beautiful and exotic, the seventeen-year-old daughter of a Romani immigrant has just moved in with her family next door to Donnie. Josie is charismatic and worldly, a wonderful mystery to be solved, and Donnie is immediately captivated by her spiritedness.&lt;p&gt;
Josie shows Donnie how exciting the world can be, whether they&#39;re flying kites in the park or having moonlit tte--ttes on the roof. They soon become inseparable, living in their own bubble of existence. But one day, they come home to find a Lincoln Continental parked in Josie&#39;s driveway. Donnie discovers that Josie has a secret, but can she trust him enough to reveal it? Donnie must protect Josie, even if it destroys his family&#39;s good name-and his life.&lt;p&gt;
