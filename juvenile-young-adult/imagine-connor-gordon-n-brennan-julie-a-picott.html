  <title>Imagine Connor - Gordon N. Brennan, Julie A. Picott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;
A talking, eating, burping clothes hamper? A rubber bathmat that turns into a small city complete with houses and people living in them? A kitchen walk-in pantry that is used as a time machine? These are just a few of the many true stories that come from a real life five-year-old boy&#39;s imagination. &quot;Imagine Connor&quot; explores the adventures of Connor as he tells us about his non video, non toy journeys in and around his home and outside his house. Find out how an ordinary Kleenex box becomes a fully functional computer, or how during an afternoon snowfall the snowflakes change into Popsicles. Connor&#39;s dad has been listening for years about how his son&#39;s imagination has helped him play in a world that is beyond reality. &quot;I&#39;ve never told him what to think about when he is playing, it all comes to him naturally,&quot; says Connor&#39;s Dad. Connor will ask the reader to participate in his quest for new stories also. Children will be able to see the transition from real life to Connor&#39;s imagination worlds through the illustrations in the book, blended with actual live action photos. Connor&#39;s dad, the book&#39;s author, states,&quot;in today&#39;s world we are bombarded with images from television, video games, hand-held devices, even electronic toys that are suggesting to our children how to play. This does not mean I am degrading these 21st Century techno marvels; they can be very helpful in the learning process for many children. Connor too has been exposed to the many manufactured toys and games that are available abd he has found them engaging enough to learn many things through interacting with them. With all that in mind, this is why I wanted to write this book to help kids use their imaginations again without any gadgets. When Connor began explaining his different stories to me and when it started becoming a large amount of adventures he was telling me, unsolicited by me, that&#39;s when I knew they needed to be written down and shared with other children. I suppose in a way it is the old story of the child receiving a brand new toy in a big box and playing with the box instead of the expensive toy.
