It is unchangeable.&lt;BR&gt;Or is it?&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Madden&amp;#8217;s life is a whirlwind of privilege and perks. Born into the elite Purple ring, she is fated to be a Minister of the Seven.

After all, Destiny Specialists have determined how she will fulfill her life&#39;s purpose, and they are never wrong.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Her classmate Dax, an Ash, is clinging to the opposite end of the spectrum. While everyone around her knows what destiny awaits them, Dax&amp;#8217;s fate is&amp;#133;missing. Isolated and ignored, she refuses to let her lack of status define her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;After a stunning twist of fate, Dax and Madden&amp;#8217;s paths intertwine in ways neither could have possibly imagined. The two are forced to question their own past, present and future as they realize who they are is not necessarily who they were meant to be.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;ASH, the first book in the Destined series, is an unforgettable journey into an alternate future which will leave readers wondering just how much we can control our own fate.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Destiny is calling.
