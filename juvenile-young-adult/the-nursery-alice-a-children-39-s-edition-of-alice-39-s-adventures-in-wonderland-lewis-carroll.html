  <title>THE NURSERY ALICE - A Children&#39;s Edition of Alice&#39;s Adventures in Wonderland - Lewis Carroll</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Nursery &amp;quot;Alice&amp;quot; is a shortened version of Alice&amp;#39;s Adventures in Wonderland created by Lewis Carroll in 1889/90 especially for children aged &amp;ldquo;0 to 5&amp;rdquo;. This edition was created twenty-five years after the original full-length work was published. Adapted by the author himself for children this is in effect an easy-to-read edition for preschool children.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It includes 20 of John Tenniel&amp;#39;s illustrations from the original book, redrawn, enlarged, coloured &amp;ndash; and, in some cases, revised &amp;ndash; by Tenniel himself&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The work is not merely a shortened and simplified version, along the lines of &amp;ldquo;Alice&amp;#39;s Adventures in Wonderland&amp;rdquo; retold in words of one syllable. It is written as though the story is being read aloud by someone who is also talking to the child/listener, with many interpolations by the author, pointing out details in the pictures and asking questions, such as &amp;quot;Which would you have liked the best, do you think, to be a little tiny Alice, no larger than a kitten, or a great tall Alice, with your head always knocking against the ceiling?&amp;quot; There are also additions, such as an anecdote about a puppy called Dash, and an explanation of the word &amp;quot;foxglove&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
