  <title>The Pig Who Became President - Alana Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Growing up on a farm full of chaos, prejudices and unfair treatment, Freddy, a shy&amp;nbsp;third grader, believed that if he could become President of Calpernia, he could really bring forth a positive change to his Gabby Land community. Although doubtful of his abilities at first, Freddy finally convinced himself that he was just as good as any other Presidential candidate, including Farmer John, who was not only jealous of Freddy, but was also Freddy&amp;rsquo;s competition in the election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite Farmer John&amp;rsquo;s angst and opposition, Freddy&amp;rsquo;s continued campaign momentum and genuine concern for the unification of all Calpernians resonated throughout the countryside. Through his confidence, Freddy gained the support of the people and not only won the election, but also became the most successful President ever in Calpernia&amp;rsquo;s history. The people of Calpernia lived happily&amp;nbsp;ever after, just as Freddy had wanted &amp;ndash; united and without prejudice.&lt;br /&gt;
