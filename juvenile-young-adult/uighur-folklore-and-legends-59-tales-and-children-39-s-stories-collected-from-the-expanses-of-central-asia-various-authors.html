  <title>UIGHUR FOLKLORE and LEGENDS - 59 tales and children&#39;s stories collected from the expanses of Central Asia - Various Authors</title>
      <meta name="description" content="We invite you to curl up with this volume and indulge yourself in the fifty-nine tales and stories that stretch back in time, almost to the great flood itself. Read about one-eyed, seven horned monsters that double as mothers-in-law, tricksters, illusionists, shape-shifters, ogres and even the origin of the meaning of fate itself.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
The Uyghur people have origins that are as ancient as the Han Chinese, if not older. Originating in central&amp;nbsp;China, they were slowly pushed further west until they settled in the&amp;nbsp;Tarim&amp;nbsp;Basin. But the Uyghurs are not just limited to East Turkestan and can also be found inhabiting the Central Asian countries of&amp;nbsp;Kazakhstan,&amp;nbsp;Kyrgyzstan, andUzbekistan. Smaller communities can also be found in&amp;nbsp;Mongolia,&amp;nbsp;Pakistan,&amp;nbsp;Afghanistan&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;Russia.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Because they have travelled so far and have encountered so many different cultures, it is therefore not surprising that Uyghur Folk-Lore is extensive, which when woven together in such a volume, results in a rich tapestry that can only be pleasing for the reader.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;NOTE: The Uyghurs are an ethnic minority, who like the Tibetans, have been fighting for their independence for generations.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
33% of the publisher&amp;rsquo;s profit from the sale of this book will be donated to UNICEF.&amp;nbsp;" />
