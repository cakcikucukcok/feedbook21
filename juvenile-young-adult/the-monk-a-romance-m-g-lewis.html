  <title>The Monk: A Romance - M. G. Lewis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Monk: A Romance is a Gothic novel by Matthew Gregory Lewis, published in 1796. A quickly written book from early in Lewis&amp;#39;s career (in one letter he claimed to have written it in ten weeks, but other correspondence suggests that he had at least started it, or something similar, a couple of years earlier), it was published before he turned twenty. It is a prime example of the male Gothic that specialises in the aspect of horror. Its convoluted and scandalous plot has made it one of the most important Gothic novels of its time, often imitated and adapted for the stage and the screen.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Newly arrived in Madrid, Leonella and her niece Antonia visit a church to hear the sermon of a celebrated monk, Ambrosio, and while waiting, tell their story to two young men, Don Lorenzo and Don Christoval. Antonia&amp;#39;s grandfather is the Marquis de las Cisternas, who was unhappy with his son&amp;#39;s marriage, causing her parents to flee, leaving their young son behind only to be told a month later that he has died. Leonella has come to Madrid to convince the Marquis&amp;#39; son, Raymond de las Cisternas, to resume their pension, which has been cut off. As the story is told, Lorenzo falls in love with Antonia. The mysterious priest, who was left at the abbey as a child, delivers the sermon, and Antonia is fascinated with him. Lorenzo vows to win the hand of Antonia, but must first visit his sister Agnes, who is a nun at the nearby abbey. Having fallen asleep in the church, he awakens to find someone delivering a letter for his sister from Raymond de las Cisternas. On the way home, a gypsy warns Antonia that she is about to die, killed by someone who appears to be honourable.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ambrosio is visited by nuns, including Agnes, for confession. She drops a letter which reveals her plans to run away with Raymond de las Cisternas. When Agnes confesses that she is pregnant with Raymond&amp;#39;s child, Ambrosio turns her over to the Prioress of her abbey for punishment. As she is led away, she curses Ambrosio. Returning to the abbey, Ambrosio&amp;#39;s constant companion, a novice named Rosario, admits that he is a woman named Matilda, who disguised herself so that she could be near Ambrosio. They both know he must throw her out of the monastery, but she begs him not to and vows to kill herself if he does. He relents, but after talking the next day she decides to leave of her own accord, on the condition Ambrosio gives her a rose to remember him by. As he picks the rose, he is bitten by a serpent and is rushed to his room where it is predicted that he will die within three days. Rosario acts as his nurse and the next day it is discovered that Ambrosio is cured, which is proclaimed a miracle. When the other monks leave, Matilda reveals that she sucked the poison from Ambrosio&amp;#39;s wound and is now dying herself. At the point of death, she begs him to make love to her and he succumbs to the temptation at last, having discovered that she is the model who sat for his beloved portrait of the Virgin Mary.&lt;br /&gt;
