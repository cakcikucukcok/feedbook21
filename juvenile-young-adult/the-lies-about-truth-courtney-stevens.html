  <title>The Lies About Truth - Courtney Stevens</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the same vein as Jandy Nelson and Gayle Forman comes a novel from the gifted author of &lt;em&gt;Faking Normal&lt;/em&gt;, Courtney C. Stevens, about hope and courage and the struggle to overcome the pain of loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sadie Kingston is living in the aftermath. A year after surviving a car accident that killed her friend Trent and left her body and face scarred, she can&amp;#39;t move forward. The only person who seems to understand her is Trent&amp;#39;s brother, Max.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Sadie begins to fall for Max, she&amp;#39;s unsure if she is truly healed enough to be with him. But Max looks at her scars and doesn&amp;#39;t shy away. And Max knows about the list she writes in the sand at the beach every night, the list of things that Sadie knows she must accomplish before she can move on from the accident. And while he can help her with number six (kiss someone without flinching), she knows she&amp;#39;s on her own with number three (forgive Gina and Gray) and the rest of the seemingly impossible tasks that must be made possible before she can live in the now again.&lt;/p&gt;" />
