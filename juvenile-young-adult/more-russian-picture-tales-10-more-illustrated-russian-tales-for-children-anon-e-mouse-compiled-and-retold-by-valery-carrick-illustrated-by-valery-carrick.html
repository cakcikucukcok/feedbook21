  <title>MORE RUSSIAN PICTURE TALES - 10 more illustrated Russian tales for children - Anon E. Mouse, Compiled and retold by Valery Carrick, Illustrated by Valery Carrick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Herein are 10 well illustrated Russian stories for children compiled and retold by Vallery Carrick. This is a collection of ten fantastic stories about Russian peasant life for young children. Because life on the steppe and in the forests was so dependent on animals and farming, it is not surprising to find comical interactions of humans with animals, particularly bears, the symbol of Russia. The text is amply illustrated with pen and ink drawings throughout.&lt;br /&gt;
Valerian (Vallery) Carrick (1869-1942) was a Norwegian author, translator, painter and Illustrator. He wrote &amp;ldquo;Picture Folk Tales&amp;rdquo; and followed this up with &amp;ldquo;More Russian Picture Tales&amp;rdquo;. Bothe were originally published in 1914 but proved so popular a rerun was ordered in 1920. The gap between the two could be ascribed to the effects of WWI on commerce.&lt;br /&gt;
The stories and adventures in this volume are:&lt;br /&gt;
The Cock and the Bean&lt;br /&gt;
The Goat and the Ram&lt;br /&gt;
The Hungry Wolf&lt;br /&gt;
The Peasant and the Bear&lt;br /&gt;
The Dog and the Cock&lt;br /&gt;
King Frost&lt;br /&gt;
The Bear&amp;#39;s Paw&lt;br /&gt;
The Bear and the Old Man&amp;#39;s Daughters&lt;br /&gt;
The Straw Ox&lt;br /&gt;
The Fox and the Blackbird&lt;br /&gt;
So, wrap up warm and come out onto the Russian steppe with me, and let us listen and watch, and I promise you it will be worthwhile.&lt;br /&gt;
This volume is sure to keep you and your young ones enchanted for hours, if not because of the quantity, then the quality of the stories. They will have you and your loved ones coming back for more, time and again.&lt;br /&gt;
