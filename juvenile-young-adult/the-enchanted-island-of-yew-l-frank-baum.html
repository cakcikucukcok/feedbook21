  <title>The Enchanted Island of Yew - L. Frank Baum</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Island of Yew is set at some undisclosed place in the Earth’s global ocean – „in the middle of the sea.” A fairy has become bored with her life, and convinces some young girls to transform her into a human boy so she can go on fast and furious adventures. Transformed, he is Prince Marvel, but he keeps his fairy powers, as they might prove handy in a world where you will quite likely encounter giants, dwarves, wizards, rowdy robber gangs, talking dragons, damsels in distress, and overgrown hedges. He takes as a sidekick a dedicated masochist, which is just one of the ways the author keeps things interesting. Full of magic, and fairies and evil hearted villains, this a good read for young adults with a love of gentle adventure stories. „The Enchanted Island of Yew” is a 1903 children’s book, a fantasy written by L. Frank Baum. It is not an Oz book, though materials in it show a clear relationship and resemblance with Baum’s most famous fantasy country." />
