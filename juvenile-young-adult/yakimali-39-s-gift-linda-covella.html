  <title>Yakimali&#39;s Gift - Linda Covella</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s 1775 in Mexico, New Spain, and 15-year-old Fernanda Marquina, of Spanish and Pima Indian ancestry, can&amp;#39;t seem to live up to her mother&amp;#39;s expectations or fit into the limited female roles of her culture. To escape, Fernanda grabs any opportunity to ride the horses she loves. At a greater cost than she could ever have imagined, her dream of adventure in faraway lands is realized. With her family, Fernanda joins Juan Bautista de Anza&amp;#39;s historic colonization expedition to California. On the arduous four-month journey, Fernanda makes friends with Feliciana, the young widow Fernanda can entrust with her deepest thoughts; Gloria, who becomes the sister Fernanda always wished for; and Gloria&amp;#39;s seductive brother Miguel, gentle one moment, angry the next and, like Fernanda, a mestizo&amp;mdash;half Indian and half Spanish. As Fernanda penetrates Miguel&amp;#39;s layers of hidden feelings, she&amp;#39;s torn between him and Nicolas, the handsome Spanish soldier hoping to win her heart. But propelling Fernanda along the journey is her search for Mama&amp;#39;s Pima Indian past, a past Mama refused to talk about, a past with secrets that Fernanda is determined to learn. The truths she discovers will change the way she sees her ancestry, her family, and herself.&lt;/p&gt;" />
