  <title>Eyes on the Goal - John Coy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Here is a story about how life, like sports, can be unpredictable, frustrating, and exhilarating. &lt;i&gt;Eyes on the Goal&lt;/i&gt;  by John Coy is part of the 4 for 4 series, an action-packed middle grade series for young readers about four boys from diverse backgrounds who deal with family, friendship, and school situations. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just before they&#39;re due to start middle school, Diego, Gig, Jackson, and Isaac, four sports-loving friends, all attend the same weeklong soccer camp. Diego is an experienced soccer player, and Gig has a natural ability for the sport he never realized. But Jackson and Isaac are split  into another group of players--a group with younger, smaller kids. For the first time, both boys aren&#39;t the stars of their team. In fact, they can&#39;t seem to get a handle on soccer. At the same time, Jackson is having a hard time getting a handle on his mom&#39;s deepening relationship with her boyfriend, and her suggestion that they move in with him. And Gig is worried about his father&#39;s deployment to Afghanistan. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Light, enjoyable reading for those downtimes between sports seasons.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;Booklist&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Coy has created a story of just the right length to keep his fans engaged. It is not necessary to have read &lt;i&gt;Top of the Order&lt;/i&gt; to appreciate this one. Hints of fall football in middle school indicate that a third book is to follow.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;School Library Journal&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
