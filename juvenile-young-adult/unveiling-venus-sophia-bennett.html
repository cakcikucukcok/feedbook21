      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Hoping to get over her first love, Felix, Mary heads with her socialite friend Kitty to Venice. There she finds herself faced with a terrible dilemma when Kitty&#39;s aristocratic fiancé, Arthur Malmesbury, declares his love for her and proposes marriage. 
Back in London, Mary hears dark rumours about Lord Arthur from her old friend Eddie - the boxer knows the aristocrat through the gambling scene. She resolves to turn Arthur down and tries to warn Kitty about his reputation. But it&#39;s only when Mary brings Kitty along to an assignation with Arthur that Kitty realises his true nature and calls the wedding off. Mary crosses paths with Felix again but although it&#39;s obvious he still loves her it&#39;s too late. Meanwhile, Eddie has agreed to throw a boxing match and is almost killed by his opponent. Mary rushes to his aid. She later hears that Eddie has booked himself on a ship to America. The question is, does Mary want to join him?&lt;/p&gt;" />
