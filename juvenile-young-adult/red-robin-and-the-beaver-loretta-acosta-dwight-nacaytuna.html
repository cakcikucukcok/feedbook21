  <title>Red Robin and the Beaver - Loretta Acosta, Dwight Nacaytuna</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Red Robin and the Beaver takes place in the giant redwood forest in northern California. Red Robin is a leisurely unhurried idled red robin bird that enjoys relaxation, dreaming in the meadow, nibbling on the bountiful meadow seeds and berries that time has slipped by. Beaver, on the other hand, is very cognizant of his well-being and his surroundings. Beaver realizes that getting ready for the winter months depend on his survival. Beaver is busy building his home on the creek and gathering his food supply for the winter months, while his neighbor Red Robin dreams his summer months away and doesnt prepare for the winter months. The friendship that Red Robin and Beaver have as neighbors is about caring and helping friends at a time of need. Red Robin leans a lesson that it is important to be prepared for the winter months, but he learns that friendship is a greater gift." />
