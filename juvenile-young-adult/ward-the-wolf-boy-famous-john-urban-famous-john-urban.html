  <title>Ward the Wolf Boy - Famous John Urban, Famous John Urban</title>
      <meta name="description" content="All his young life growing up at the Home for Young Gentleman Orphanage a talented but misunderstood boy named Ward was told that he was different than the other boys and didnt fit in because he had recurring dreams about half men, half wolf monsters and obsessively drew them. But were these visions dreams or memories? Was his diagnosis of having sleep tremors accurate or was he in fact starting to turn into a werewolf?  There is truth to all myths and legends, and sometimes the worst monsters are not the ones hiding in closets or under beds. Ward the Wolf Boy explores overcoming abuse and neglect and embracing your true inner self, and Ward finds out that being a werewolf doesnt make you a bad person.
What makes this book unique is several key factors. Werewolves are usually mindless killing monsters and they are usually just a sidekick for vampires or wizards and are rarely a main character in books despite their popularity. Ward and the other werewolves in &quot;Ward the Wolf Boy&quot; is more of a shape shifter and not a monster or a killer. In this adaption of the werewolf legend when werewolves turn they can still speak and think and behave like their normal human selves, only with greater strength and keener wolf like senses. While there are vampires in the series, they are the natural enemies of werewolves and they are grotesque teritorial killers. But this book is primarily about werewolves. They are the stars and heros of the series.
&quot;Ward the Wolf Boy, Night Terrors&quot; is an introduction to the heros and villains of the series of books that are already in the planning stages. It appeals to the young and young at heart, and the author hopes that its readers will grow up with the young boy werewolf as he understands and fullfills his destiny." />
