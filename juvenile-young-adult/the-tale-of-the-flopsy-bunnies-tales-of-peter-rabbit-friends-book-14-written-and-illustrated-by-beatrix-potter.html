  <title>THE TALE OF THE FLOPSY BUNNIES - Tales of Peter Rabbit &amp; Friends Book 14 - Written and Illustrated By Beatrix Potter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;The Tale of The Flopsy Bunnies&lt;/b&gt; is a children&amp;#39;s book written and illustrated by Beatrix Potter, and first published in July 1909.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In &lt;b&gt;The Flopsy Bunnies&lt;/b&gt;, Benjamin Bunny and his cousin Flopsy are the parents of six young rabbits called simply The Flopsy Bunnies. The story concerns how the Flopsy Bunnies, while raiding a rubbish heap of rotting vegetables, fall asleep and are captured by Mr. McGregor who places them in a sack. While McGregor is distracted, the six are freed by Thomasina Tittlemouse, a woodmouse, and the sack filled with rotten vegetables by Benjamin and Flopsy. At home, Mr. McGregor proudly presents the sack to his wife, but receives a sharp scolding when she discovers its actual content.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
NOTE: After two full-length tales about rabbits, Potter had grown weary of the subject and was reluctant to write another. She realized however that children most enjoyed her rabbit stories and pictures, and so reached back to characters and plot elements from The Tale of Peter Rabbit (1902) and The Tale of Benjamin Bunny (1904) to create The Flopsy Bunnies. A semi-formal garden of archways and flowerbeds in Wales at the home of her uncle and aunt became the background for the illustrations.&lt;br /&gt;
