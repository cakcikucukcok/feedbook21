      <meta name="description" content="Daffney&#39;s Island 
This island is mine. Well, I just call it mine, but that&#39;s cause a bajillion things always happen around here, and I&#39;m right in the middle of them all. But that&#39;s me, Daffney the explorer. Daffney the adventure seeker. Daffney the &quot;catch me if you can kind, but that&#39;s cause I can climb a tree faster than a lizard. 
With a little imagination, you and me can go anywhere.
Not a bad place to grow up, right?
Daffney&#39;s Grandma Thinks She&#39;s a Doctor
I&#39;m scared of that grandma. That&#39;s cause when I&#39;m sick, she makes me get the shakees cause she does crazy things to get me better. Will I come out of this one alive or will I have to make a run for it? 
Daffney&#39;s Birthday
Birthday cakes and presents are supposed to be special. Whatever could have gone wrong with Daffney&#39;s? Which kid wants to get &quot;that not wanted thing for their birthday anyway?
Daffney&#39;s Canoe
A Canoe is supposed to be fun. Except that the stupid chores even jump in that thing! But it&#39;s not my fault. I tell ya, it&#39;s not!
Daffney&#39;s New Dress
That new dress is very important; after all,That boy is going to be at that party, and I really have to look all cute and everything.
Will my Thinker show me how to get it, and will I like what it shows me?
Daffney Builds a Kite
Daffney had everything except the most important item to build her kite. What can she find to trade for it? Can she make it happen anyway?" />
