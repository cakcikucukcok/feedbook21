  <title>Rock The Boat - Tim Lay, Augustine Coll, Lesline James</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Rock the Boat is a modern interpretation of the best selling Victorian classic &#39;Three Men in a Boat by Jerome K. Jerome.  We follow a fame hungry teenage rock band along The River Thames on route to play at the famous music event &#39;Reading Festival&#39;. The problem is, they&#39;re not booked to perform and no one knows who they are! They consider this a minor detail and put their plans into action to go viral and become the new international rock sensation!  Access into the festival lies with the a band&#39;s front man Jerome, who is expecting festival tickets for his birthday. But excitement turns to despair when a misunderstanding delivers wrong tickets and a boat trip!  The old boat has seen better days but determined not to let this ruin their big break, Jerome is forced to improvise to sail the band to stardom.  He convinces his band mates to take to the water in the dilapidated boat, but a catalogue of errors and encounters with unwelcome guests cause plenty of waves along the way. This cruise is far from plain sailing - will they make it to the festival on time, and will they go viral for all the wrong reasons?   Trashed Classics puts a new spin on literary fiction to make it accessible and relevant for a new generation. With modern interpretations, diverse engaging characters, and references to popular culture, readers are encouraged to identify with a traditional genre that might otherwise be dismissed as dated, uninspiring and irrelevant." />
