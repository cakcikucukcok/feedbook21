  <title>They do Things Differently Here - Owen W Knight</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When the Waldens move to Templewood, teenagers Emily and Peter find that leaving the City for &amp;lsquo;a quieter life in the country&amp;rsquo; is the least of their problems. Bubbling beneath the surface of their new home are challenges that could change their world forever &amp;hellip;and end ours.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Templewood is so isolated it is not on the map and has no communications links with the outside world. The village is home to the Sect, a divided organisation planning an apocalyptic event intended to establish world domination, but which may destroy the planet. Emily and Peter&amp;rsquo;s arrival is no accident; their parents may know more than they admit. Could Peter really hold the key to trigger a world-changing event? One by one, mysteries are uncovered, until the terrifying objective of the Sect becomes clear. There is little time in which to find who is responsible.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;How far will they go? &amp;nbsp;Should they be stopped?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Can they be stopped?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you were the only ones who could save the world, where would you start? Who would you trust?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;1984 Meets the Book of Revelation&amp;rsquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;They do Things Differently Here&amp;#39; is&amp;nbsp;Book One of the Invisible College Trilogy&lt;/p&gt;" />
