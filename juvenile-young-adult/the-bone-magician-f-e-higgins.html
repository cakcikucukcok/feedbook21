  <title>The Bone Magician - F. E. Higgins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Pin Carpue is on his own in the world. His mother is dead and his father is missing after being labeled a suspect in a rash of murders.  Pin finds a job working for the local undertaker as a body watcher, making sure people are really dead before they&#39;re buried. The body he&#39;s supposed to be watching tonight is currently surrounded by three people engaged in a most unusual ceremony. An old man, a bone magician, and his young female assistant are waking a woman so her grieving fiancé can have one last goodbye with her. Pin can&#39;t believe it will work, but then the dead woman sits up and speaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pin is determined to discover how the magic works.  He cannot believe they are raising the dead. He cannot believe his father is a murderer. Then Pin himself nearly becomes the killer&#39;s next victim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As this mysterious tale unfolds with delicious creepiness, Pin will learn more about the bone magician, the girl Juno, and a hideous creature called the Gluttonous Beast that is kept in a local tavern where people pay for a glimpse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once again, F.E. Higgins delivers a story that is full of intrigue and suspense.&lt;/p&gt;" />
