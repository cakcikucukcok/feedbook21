  <title>Alice&#39;s Adventures in Wonderland - Lewis Carroll, Sbp Editors</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Life gets strange when Alice sees a white rabbit wearing a coat and gloves. Then she follows him down a hole. Suddenly she grows smaller, larger, smaller, larger, smaller--and almost drown in her own tears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She meets a dodo, a lizard, a smoking caterpillar, a duchess... a cat without a grin. Then a grin--without a cat. She has a mad tea party with a hatter and a hare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And a madder croquet game with a King--where playing card soldiers are the hoops, flamingoes are the mallets, hedgehogs are the balls and the Queen of Hearts cries &amp;quot;OFF WITH THEIR HEADS!&amp;quot; Which lands Alice, the mock turtle, and a gryphon (a what?) at a trial without rules where death is the penalty! In Wonderland, anything can happen...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And probably, anything will....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ABOUT THE AUTHOR:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lewis Carroll&lt;/strong&gt; was the pen name of Charles Lutwidge Dodgson who was born 27 January 1832. He was an English writer, mathematician, logician, Anglican deacon and photographer. His most famous writings are Alice&amp;rsquo;s Adventures in Wonderland and its sequel Through the Looking-Glass, as well as the poems &amp;ldquo;The Hunting of the Snark&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Jabberwocky&amp;rdquo;, all examples of the genre of literary nonsense. He is noted for his facility at word play, logic, and fantasy, and there are societies in many parts of the world (including the United Kingdom, Japan, the United States, and New Zealand dedicated to the enjoyment and promotion of his works and the investigation of his life. He died &amp;ndash; 14 January 1898.&lt;/p&gt;" />
