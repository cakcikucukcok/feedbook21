  <title>Isaiah’S Many Hats - Camisha Montgomery, Salvador Capuyan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When Isaiah left for school, the air was cold and the sky was gray. His blue hat was on his head, where his mommy wanted it to stay. But when he was in school, he had to take his hat off. 
Uh-oh, thought Mommy, I hope it does not get lost.
When Isaiah came home, she said, Where is your hat? Isaiah looked around, his eyes wide as a bat. Then his mommy said, Do you know where it is at? His coat, mittens, and scarf were also not on the coat rack." />
