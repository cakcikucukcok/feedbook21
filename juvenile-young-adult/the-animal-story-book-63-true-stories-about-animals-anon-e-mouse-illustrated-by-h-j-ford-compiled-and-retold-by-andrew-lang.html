  <title>THE ANIMAL STORY BOOK - 63 true stories about animals - Anon E. Mouse,  Illustrated by H. J. Ford, Compiled and Retold by Andrew Lang</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;Herein are 63 illustrated true stories about animals &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;which every child will enjoy!&lt;/i&gt; In this book you will find stories about bears, otters, eagles, horses, dogs, dolphins, ants, frogs, elephants, parrots, snakes, lions, Cayman, weasels and many, many more besides.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;The Animal Story Book&amp;quot; will delight both old and young, as one may find therein pen-portraits of most of the remarkable animals that have interested the world since primitive times.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Herein are stories like:&lt;br /&gt;
Sa&amp;iuml; The Panther&lt;br /&gt;
The Buzzard And The Priest&lt;br /&gt;
A Rat&amp;rsquo;s Tale&lt;br /&gt;
The Dog Of Montargis&lt;br /&gt;
The Taming of an Otter&lt;br /&gt;
The Adventures Of Pyramus&lt;br /&gt;
The Dancing Dog&lt;br /&gt;
Monkey Stories&lt;br /&gt;
The War Horse Of Alexander&lt;br /&gt;
Madame Th&amp;eacute;ophile And The Parrot&lt;br /&gt;
and many, many more. The 66 pen and ink illustrations by H J Ford give added life to the stories.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Unlike his fairy collections, these tales compiled by Andrew Lang are all &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; with some species descriptions coming from nature journals of the time and others being more personal memoir/anecdote type stories of individual&amp;#39;s pets.&lt;br /&gt;
Not as well known today, was that the author Alexandre Dumas maintained a veritable menagerie, as did the artist Alexandre-Gabriel Decamps, and Andrew Lang has featured many stories about the various animals in their menageries.&lt;br /&gt;
But, if anyone believes that style does not appeal to the young readers, let him open this book and read to any intelligent child of nine years Dumas&amp;rsquo; description of Mysouf the cat, and Pritchard the dog.&lt;br /&gt;
