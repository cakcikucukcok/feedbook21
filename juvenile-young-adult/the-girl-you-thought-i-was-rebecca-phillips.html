  <title>The Girl You Thought I Was - Rebecca Phillips</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;A smart and savvy take on coming of age and coming to terms, with a little help from your friends.&amp;#8221;&amp;#8212;Huntley Fitzpatrick, author of &lt;em&gt;My Life Next Door&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one looking at Morgan Kemper would think she had a secret&amp;#8212;at least not one that she&amp;#8217;s deeply ashamed of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To everyone she meets, she comes across as sweet, pretty, and put together. But Morgan knows that looks can be deceiving. For over a year, she&amp;#8217;s shoplifted countless pieces of clothing and makeup. Each time, she tells herself it will be the last, and each time, it never is. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when she&amp;#8217;s caught and sentenced to thirty hours of community service, the image Morgan has carefully constructed starts to crumble. She&amp;#8217;s determined to complete her punishment without her friends discovering the truth about her sticky fingers, but that&amp;#8217;s easier said than done...especially once she meets Eli, the charming, handsome nephew of the owner of the charity shop where Morgan is volunteering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon Morgan is faced with an impossible decision: continue to conceal the truth or admit that she&amp;#8217;s lied to everyone in her life, including the boy she&amp;#8217;s falling for. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Praise for &lt;em&gt;The Girl You Thought I Was&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;A charming and poignant ode to the seasons of friendship, family, and love, and what happens when we dare to reveal our most messy selves.
