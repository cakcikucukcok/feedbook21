  <title>None of the Above - I. W. Gregorio</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A groundbreaking story about a teenage girl who discovers she&#39;s intersex . . . and what happens when her secret is revealed to the entire school. Incredibly compelling and sensitively told, None of the Above is a thought-provoking novel that explores what it means to be a boy, a girl, or something in between.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What if everything you knew about yourself changed in an instant?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Kristin Lattimer is voted homecoming queen, it seems like another piece of her ideal life has fallen into place. She&#39;s a champion hurdler with a full scholarship to college and she&#39;s madly in love with her boyfriend. In fact, she&#39;s decided that she&#39;s ready to take things to the next level with him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Kristin&#39;s first time isn&#39;t the perfect moment she&#39;s planned&amp;#8212;something is very wrong. A visit to the doctor reveals the truth: Kristin is intersex, which means that though she outwardly looks like a girl, she has male chromosomes, not to mention boy &quot;parts.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dealing with her body is difficult enough, but when her diagnosis is leaked to the whole school, Kristin&#39;s entire identity is thrown into question. As her world unravels, can she come to terms with her new self? &lt;/p&gt;" />
