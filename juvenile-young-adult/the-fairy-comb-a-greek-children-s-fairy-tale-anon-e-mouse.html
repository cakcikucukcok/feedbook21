  <title>THE FAIRY COMB - A Greek Children’s Fairy Tale - Anon E. Mouse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 284&lt;br /&gt;
In this 284th issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; series, Baba Indaba narrates the Greek fairy Tale of &amp;ldquo;THE FAIRY COMB&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is a story about Galanis, a Greek fisherman. One day while fishing he spies a cave in a cliff. He moors his boat and climbs to the cave. This tale tells the story of his love for a fairy maiden and hers for him. But fairies and mortals are not meant to fall in love. Only in exceptional circumstances are they two species allowed to love &amp;ndash; and only when one relinquishes the world they grew up in.&lt;br /&gt;
What happened to Galanis and his fairy maiden? Was their love for one another ever requited? Did they live happily ever after?&lt;br /&gt;
