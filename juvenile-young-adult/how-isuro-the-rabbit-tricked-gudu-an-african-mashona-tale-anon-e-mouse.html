  <title>HOW ISURO THE RABBIT TRICKED GUDU - An African, Mashona Tale - Anon E. Mouse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 369&lt;br /&gt;
In this 369th issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;series, Baba Indaba narrates the African, Mashona Tale &amp;quot;HOW ISURO THE RABBIT TRICKED GUDU&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
ONCE upon a time, long, long ago in Mashonaland, a hot place in Northern Zimbabwe, where the forests are very thick and dark, and the rivers very swift and strong, there once lived a strange pair of friends. Now one of the friends was a big white rabbit named Isuro, and the other was a tall baboon called Gudu, and so fond were they of each other that they were seldom seen apart.&lt;br /&gt;
One day, when the sun was hotter even than usual, the rabbit awoke from his midday sleep, and saw Gudu the baboon standing beside him.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lsquo;Get up,&amp;rsquo; said Gudu; &amp;lsquo;I am going courting, and you must come with me. So put some food in a bag, and sling it round your neck, for we may not be able to find anything to eat for a long while.&amp;rsquo;&lt;br /&gt;
Then the rabbit rubbed his eyes, and gathered a store of fresh green things from under the bushes, and told Gudu that he was ready for the journey. So off they went&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;
But what happened along the way you ask&amp;hellip;? Well many things happened, some strange, some silly and some serious, for Africa can be a strange land. To find the answers to these questions, and others you may have, you will have to download and read this story to find out!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Baba Indaba is a fictitious Zulu storyteller who narrates children&amp;#39;s stories from around the world. Baba Indaba translates as &amp;quot;Father of Stories&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Each issue also has a &amp;quot;&lt;b&gt;WHERE IN THE WORLD - LOOK IT UP&lt;/b&gt;&amp;quot; section, where young readers are challenged to look up a place on a map somewhere in the world. The place, town or city is relevant to the story. &lt;i&gt;HINT - use Google maps.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
