  <title>A Child&#39;s Garden of Verses - Robert Louis Stevenson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This volume contains a compilation of delightful children&#39;s poems written by Robert Louis Stevenson. This timeless treasury is ideal for introducing children to poetry, and it would make for a great addition to collections of related literature. The poems of this anthology include: &quot;Bed in Summer&quot;, &quot;A Thought&quot;, &quot;At the Sea-Side&quot;, &quot;Young Night-Thought&quot;, &quot;Whole Duty of Children&quot;, &quot;Rain&quot;, &quot;Pirate Story&quot;, &quot;Foreign Lands&quot;, &quot;Windy Nights&quot;, &quot;Travel&quot;, &quot;Singing&quot;, &quot;Looking Forward&quot;, &quot;A Good Play&quot;, and more. Robert Louis Balfour Stevenson (1850 - 1894) was a famous Scottish essayist, novelist, poet, and travel writer whose famous works include &quot;Treasure Island&quot; and &quot;The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde&quot;. Many vintage texts such as this are increasingly scarce and expensive, and it is with this in mind that we are republishing this book now, in an affordable, high-quality, modern edition. It comes complete with a specially commissioned biography of the author." />
