  <title>THE CELESTIAL ROBE OF FEATHERS - A Japanese Legend - Anon E. Mouse, Narrated by Baba Indaba</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 417&lt;br /&gt;
In this 417th issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;series, Baba Indaba narrates the Japanese legend &amp;quot;THE CELESTIAL ROBE OF FEATHERS&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A long time ago and far, far away, in the third year after the Japanese Royal Hunt, and in the spring-time, the Lady Kaguya continually gazed at the moon. On the seventh month, when the moon was full, the Lady Kaguya&amp;#39;s sorrow increased so that her weeping distressed the maidens who served her. At last they went to the Bamboo-cutter, and said: &amp;quot;Long has the Lady Kaguya watched the moon, waxing in melancholy with the waxing thereof, and her woe now passes all measure, and sorely she weeps and wails; wherefore we request you to speak with her.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When the Bamboo-cutter discussed this with his daughter, he requested that she should tell him the cause of her sorrow, and was informed that the sight of the moon caused her to reflect upon the wretchedness of the world.&lt;br /&gt;
During the eighth month the Lady Kaguya explained to her maids that she was no ordinary mortal, but that her birthplace was the Capital of Moonland, and that the time was now at hand when she was destined to leave the world and return to her old home.&lt;br /&gt;
Not only was the Bamboo-cutter heart-broken at this sorrowful news, but the Mikado also was considerably troubled when he heard of the proposed departure of the Lady Kaguya.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What happened next you ask&amp;hellip;? Well many things happened, but what were these occurrences? To find the answers to these questions, and others you may have, you will have to download and read this story to find out!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
INCLUDES LINKS TO DOWNLOAD 8 FREE STORIES&lt;br /&gt;

Baba Indaba is a fictitious Zulu storyteller who narrates children&amp;#39;s stories from around the world. Baba Indaba translates as &amp;quot;Father of Stories&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
