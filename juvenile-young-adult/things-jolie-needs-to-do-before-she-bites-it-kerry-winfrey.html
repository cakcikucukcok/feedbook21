  <title>Things Jolie Needs to Do Before She Bites It - Kerry Winfrey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kerry Winfrey&#39;s funny and honest YA novel, &lt;i&gt;Things Jolie Needs to Do Before She Bites It&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jolie&#39;s a lot of things, but she knows that pretty isn&#39;t one of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She has mandibular prognathism, which is the medical term for underbite.  Chewing is a pain, headaches are a common occurrence, and she&#39;s never been kissed. She&#39;s months out from having a procedure to correct her underbite, and she cannot wait to be fixed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jolie becomes paralyzed with the fear that she could die under the knife. She and her best friends, Evelyn and Derek, decide to make a &quot;Things Jolie Needs to Do Before She Bites It (Which Is Super Unlikely, but Still, It Could Happen)&quot; list. Things like: eat every appetizer on the Applebee&#39;s menu and kiss her crush Noah Reed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But since when did everything ever go exactly to plan? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Filled with humor, heart--and an honest look at today&#39;s beauty standards--Jolie&#39;s journey is a true feel-good story.&lt;/p&gt;" />
