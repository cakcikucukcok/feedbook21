  <title>The Girl Who Could Fly - Victoria Forester</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;You just can&#39;t keep a good girl down . . . unless you use the proper methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Piper McCloud can fly. Just like that. Easy as pie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sure, she hasn&#39;t mastered reverse propulsion and her turns are kind of sloppy, but she&#39;s real good at loop-the-loops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Problem is, the good folk of Lowland County are afraid of Piper. And her ma&#39;s at her wit&#39;s end. So it seems only fitting that she leave her parents&#39; farm to attend a top-secret, maximum-security school for kids with exceptional abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;School is great at first with a bunch of new friends whose skills range from super-strength to super-genius. (Plus all the homemade apple pie she can eat!) But Piper is special, even among the special. And there are consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consequences too dire to talk about. Too crazy to consider. And too dangerous to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At turns exhilarating and terrifying, Victoria Forester&#39;s debut novel has been praised by Stephenie Meyer, author of the Twilight saga, as &quot;the oddest/sweetest mix of &lt;i&gt;Little House on the Prairie&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;X-Men&lt;/i&gt;...Prepare to have your heart warmed.&quot; &lt;i&gt;The Girl Who Could Fly&lt;/i&gt; is an unforgettable story of defiance and courage about an irrepressible heroine who can, who will, who must . . . fly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This title has Common Core connections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Praise for Victoria Forester and &lt;i&gt;The Girl Who Could Fly&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&#39;s the oddest/sweetest mix of &lt;i&gt;Little House on the Prairie&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;X-Men&lt;/i&gt;. I was smiling the whole time (except for the part where I cried). I gave it to my mom, and I&#39;m reading it to my kids--it&#39;s absolutely multigenerational. Prepare to have your heart warmed.&quot; Stephenie Meyer, author of the Twilight saga&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;In this terrific debut novel, readers meet Piper McCloud, the late-in-life daughter of farmers...The story soars, just like Piper, with enough loop-de-loops to keep kids uncertain about what will come next....Best of all are the book&#39;s strong, lightly wrapped messages about friendship and authenticity and the difference between doing well and doing good.&quot;--&lt;i&gt;Booklist, &lt;/i&gt;Starred Review&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Forester&#39;s disparate settings (down-home farm and futuristic ice-bunker institute) are unified by the rock-solid point of view and unpretentious diction... any child who has felt different will take strength from Piper&#39;s fight to be herself against the tide of family, church, and society.&quot;--&lt;i&gt;The Horn Book Review&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Girl Who Could Fly&lt;/i&gt; is a 2009 Bank Street - Best Children&#39;s Book of the Year.&lt;/p&gt;" />
