      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 449&lt;br /&gt;
In this 449th issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;series, Baba Indaba narrates the Turkish Fairy Tale &amp;ldquo;The Bird of Sorrow&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
ONCE, UPON A TIME, a long, long time ago and far, far away, there lived a Padishah (an Eastern King) whose daughter was much attached to her governess that she scarcely ever left her side.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One day, seeing the latter deep in thought, the Princess asked: &amp;quot;Of what are you thinking?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;I have sorrow,&amp;quot; answered the governess. &amp;quot;What is sorrow?&amp;quot; questioned the Padishah&amp;#39;s daughter; &amp;quot;let me also have it.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;It is well,&amp;quot; said the woman, and went to the tscharschi, the bazaar, where she bought a Bird of Sorrow in a cage. She presented it to the maiden, who was so delighted that she amused herself day and night with the creature.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Some time afterwards the Sultan&amp;#39;s daughter, attended by her slaves, paid a visit to the Zoo. She took with her the bird in its cage, which she hung upon the branch of a tree. Suddenly the bird commenced to speak. &amp;quot;Set me free a little while, Sultana,&amp;quot; it pleaded, &amp;quot;that I may play with the other birds. I will come back again.&amp;quot; The Princess accordingly set her favourite at liberty.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But then what happened you may ask? What happened to the bird? Did it fly away abd was it ever seen again? What magic did the bird have and what happened to the Princess? How did everything turn out in the end? Well, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to download and read this story to find out for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;
