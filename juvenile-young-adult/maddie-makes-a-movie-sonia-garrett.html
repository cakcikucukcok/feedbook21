  <title>Maddie Makes a Movie - Sonia Garrett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Maddie&amp;rsquo;s not your typical fifth-grader. With an electric skateboard, a stuntman dad, and a head full of crazy ideas, she often finds herself on the wrong side of Principal Richardson&amp;mdash;particularly when that tattletale Raquel is always trying to get her into trouble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Maddie founds a playground society celebrating the noble art of falling onto heaped cardboard boxes, Principle Richardson challenges Maddie to &lt;em&gt;please, please&lt;/em&gt; find a constructive outlet for her creativity. He knows just the thing: The Young Filmmaker of the Year Award.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, things don&amp;rsquo;t exactly get off to a good start: Maddie&amp;rsquo;s adaptation of &lt;em&gt;Red Riding Hood &lt;/em&gt;ends in an unscripted battle scene, and &lt;em&gt;Rapunzel &lt;/em&gt;hits a wall when Maddie&amp;rsquo;s best friend Leila is left dangling above the playground by her hair. With the deadline swiftly approaching and Raquel&amp;rsquo;s smug taunting becoming too much to bear, Maddie will need every idea she can think of and every friend she can find to make sure her final movie, &lt;em&gt;Cinderella&lt;/em&gt;, wows the judges&amp;mdash;maybe then Principal Richardson will get off her back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Maddie Makes a Movie &lt;/em&gt;is the hilarious, heart-warming debut by Sonia Garrett, and is a must for young readers with big ideas (as well as the parents who fear them!).&lt;/p&gt;" />
