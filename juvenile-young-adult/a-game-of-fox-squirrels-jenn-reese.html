Sam wants nothing more than to go back to the way things were... before she spoke up about their father&#39;s anger.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Aunt Vicky gives Sam a mysterious card game called &quot;A Game of Fox &amp; Squirrels,&quot; Sam falls in love with the animal characters, especially the charming trickster fox, Ashander. Then one day Ashander shows up in Sam&#39;s room and offers her an adventure and a promise: find the Golden Acorn, and Sam can have anything she desires. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the fox is hiding rules that Sam isn&#39;t prepared for, and her new home feels more tempting than she&#39;d ever expected. As Sam is swept up in the dangerous quest, the line between magic and reality grows thin. If she makes the wrong move, she&#39;ll lose far more than just a game.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Perfect for fans of Barbara O&#39;Connor, Lauren Wolk, and Ali Benjamin, &lt;i&gt;A Game of Fox &amp; Squirrels&lt;/i&gt; is a stunning, heartbreaking novel about a girl who finds the light in the darkness... and ultimately discovers the true meaning of home.&lt;/p&gt;" />
