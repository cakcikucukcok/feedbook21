The kind that swallows you like a black hole. His brother committed suicide, his mother left him, and his dad ignores him inside their cavernous house. Relief seems to come only from drugs, alcohol, and secret acts of self-destruction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until he met Evie. Together, they lived in the moment.
