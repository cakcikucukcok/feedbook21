  <title>Constantly Cooper - Denise Grubbs Harrill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Cooper is golden, furry, and a beloved member of the family. His blocky head contains the silliness and devotion that come through clearly in his chocolate pudding eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A goofy, lovable golden retriever, Cooper makes his way from Kansas City, Kansas, to meet his new family in Birmingham, Alabama. Whats more, he arrives right when they need him the most. After an airplane ride, he gets to his new home just in time for it to be visited by firetrucks, who come to put out the flames in the dining room. Then Cooper learns to do his business outside, although he believes hes too young to start a business. Over time he grows older and gets to know more about his home and his family. He even gets a sister who is a cat and finds many ways to get into trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this tale told in his own words, a golden retriever shares how he perceives the world around him, the non-furries in his family, and his relationship with them.&lt;/p&gt;" />
