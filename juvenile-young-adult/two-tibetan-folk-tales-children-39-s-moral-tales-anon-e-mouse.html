  <title>TWO TIBETAN FOLK TALES - Children&#39;s Moral Tales - Anon E. Mouse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 434&lt;br /&gt;
In this 434th issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;series, Baba Indaba narrates two Tibetan Fairy tales, each with a moral, being &amp;ldquo;The Tiger and the Frog&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;The Story of the Donkey and the Rock&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the first story, the tiger, which lives in the jungle, is hungry. He starts looking for food but finds it hard to come by. He is so hungry that even a frog will do for dinner thinking that he will catch the biggest, fattest frog.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He arrives at the pond and sees many frogs. When they see the tiger many take refuge in the pond, except for one who sits on a lily pad in the middle of the pond. A conversation follows&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip; Can you guess what was said? Did the tiger get to eat the frog for his dinner? Well, you will have to download and read the story to find out.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In our second story, The Story Of The Donkey And The Rock which is a Black Tent Story. A man was walking up a steep hill, trading oil from house to house. Halfway up he was tired and sat down to rest. He placed the jar of oil on a rock beside him.&lt;br /&gt;
At the same time another man was driving his donkey down the same hill. As the donkey passed, part of the load on the donkey&amp;rsquo;s back knocked over and broke the jar of oil and the oil trader was understandably annoyed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Well, what happened? Did the pair agree it was an accident and agree to go their own ways or did something else happen? To find the answer to this question, and any others you may have, you will have to download and read this story to find out!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
