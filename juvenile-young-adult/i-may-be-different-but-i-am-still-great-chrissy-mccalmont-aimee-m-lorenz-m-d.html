  <title>I May Be Different, but I Am Still Great! - Chrissy McCalmont, Aimee M. Lorenz M.D</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Growing up has never been easy and one of the most traumatic things I can still remember, even at fifty, was being picked on and teased. Times were different though and although words cut like a knife we never could have imagined the same knife would be the knife cutting our own children. Who knew that bullying a child with cruel words would go so viral that they were shamed through a never ending internet that left them to be found hanging in their closets, or lying beside a smoking gun, or in a bathtub with slit wrists and of course the famous empty pill bottle. Is this harsh to hear? Yes, you bet it is! But it happens all too regularly. In my hometown area at least five young teens over the last two years have taken their own lives because they were bullied! Why? Because they were different. This book is not designed to help prepare your child for college or to help get them a high profile paying job one day. This book was written to teach them to be children, to love themselves for exactly who they are, that no matter what God loves them with all his being and that they are never alone and that however they may be feeling there is always someone else out there who is feeling the same! So instead of giving up, start reaching out to one another, draw on one another&#39;s strengths you can beat this ugly monster. This book was also designed to help mommies and daddies who may struggle with the right things to say to their child. Its not always easy to approach these issues and as parents we can choose to hide our heads in the sand or begin taking the early steps to be a part of building a strength and bond with our children that creates a beautiful human being." />
