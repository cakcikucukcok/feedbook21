  <title>Subway Girl - P. J. Converse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is shy. Unassuming. Inexperienced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She is Subway Girl. Cool. Unattainable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the moment he sees her on a Hong Kong subway, Simon is intrigued by Amy, but he doesn&#39;t have the nerve to talk to her. When he finally works up the courage, he realizes he can&#39;t. Because Amy doesn&#39;t speak Chinese, and Simon is failing English.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But somehow, Amy and Simon connect, and they find that they understand each other. Enough for Simon to admit that he is dropping out of school. Enough for Amy to confess that she is pregnant with her ex-boyfriend&#39;s baby. Amy and Simon feel lost in a world so much bigger than they are, and yet they still have each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this brilliant debut by P. J. Converse, two unlikely teenagers discover that love has a language all its own.&lt;/p&gt;" />
