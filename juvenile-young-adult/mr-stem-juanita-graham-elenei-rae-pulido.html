  <title>Mr. Stem - Juanita Graham, Elenei Rae Pulido</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Mr. STEM is a book that introduces elementary-age students to the world of science, technology engineering, and math by using their everyday surroundings to make it more understandable. The objective of Mr. STEM is to sow a seed in the mind of the elementary student that science, technology, engineering, and math is the way of life in this twenty-first century. It will also prepare them early enough to fully understand the importance of learning STEM for future careers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US rank twenty-seventh in science out of thirty-four countries and twenty-fourth in math out of thirty-four countries, partly due to a lack of exposure to STEM education at an early age. Alabama STEM Education has been organized to do just that as an after-school program. Since its inception in 2014, more than five hundred students and over 1,200 adults have been made aware of what STEM is. As we continue our efforts of STEM awareness with products such as Mr. Books, STEM after-school programs, and open forums, the US will get closer to regaining its rightful position as number one in STEM-related fields. The Mr. STEM book is designed to be bold, colorful, and very easy to read with out-of-the-box thinking in it. Learning STEM early is a win-win, not just for the students that read it but also our communities and, ultimately, our country!&lt;/p&gt;" />
