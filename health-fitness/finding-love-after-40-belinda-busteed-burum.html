  <title>Finding Love After 40 - Belinda Busteed Burum</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Why is it that we begin to feel the ticking of time around the age of 40? Whether we are happily ensconced in a loving relationship or we&amp;rsquo;re just getting started, something simply seems to shift. If we&amp;rsquo;re married, we may ask ourselves who we truly are and if we want to stay with our mate for the long haul; if we&amp;rsquo;re not married, we may have the sense that we&amp;rsquo;d better get moving, especially if we want to have a family. And what about those who have long passed 40? Those who have gone through divorce or losing a spouse and still want to believe that love is possible later in life?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Belinda Busteed Burum, herself a hopeless romantic, set out to prove that true love is possible at any age, that we don&amp;rsquo;t have to settle for less than our heart&amp;rsquo;s desire. Through conducting numerous interviews, reading scores of books and blogs, and speaking to experts, she sought to learn the secrets of &amp;ldquo;those who got it right, even if by accident&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;those who waited patiently or impatiently for years, those who may have given up on love and were not waiting at all, those who were happy and grateful and still couldn&amp;rsquo;t believe their good fortune, sometimes even after years of being together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From a couple who met in preschool and reunited in their 30s, to thrice-divorced singles who found love online, to couples falling in love in their 80s and 90s, the stories in this book corroborate that our path to the Promised Land of love is often circuitous&amp;mdash;involving life experience, self-inquiry, and relationships that don&amp;rsquo;t work out quite as we envision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this is not one of the many books that offer a formula for unearthing your perfect match,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Finding Love After 40&lt;/em&gt;contains some definite clues about how to discover one&amp;mdash;as well as insights about what&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;not&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;to do along the way. In witnessing the simple yet profound wisdom within real stories of ordinary people who wake up every morning next to the love of their life, the author hopes you&amp;rsquo;ll gain the belief that love is possible, no matter your foibles, past missteps, or what you may view as regrettable decisions. And if you&amp;rsquo;re already in a fulfilling relationship, she hopes you will enjoy reading other people&amp;rsquo;s love stories and smile, because you already know that it&amp;rsquo;s never too late to enjoy the magic of love.&lt;/p&gt;" />
