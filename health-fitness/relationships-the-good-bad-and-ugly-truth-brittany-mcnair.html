  <title>Relationships: The Good, Bad and Ugly Truth - Brittany McNair</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What is it with relationships!? The cheating, the sex and the arguments. The growth, the lessons and the love. All the good and the bad. One day it&#39;s paradise and the next it&#39;s a war zone. We all deal with something within our relationship, what do we do? How do we handle the situations that arise? Don&#39;t worry you&#39;re not alone. More people than you think go through similar issues everyday. With three main topics this book will provide insight to my personal experiences and how I handled them. Chapter One: Cheating, if you stay how to make it work. Chapter Two: Lacking Sexually, how to support your partner dealing with a form of erectile dysfunction. Chapter Three: Realizing It Won&#39;t Work(two sections ). The first section talks about a toxic relationship where arguments are constant and the negative outweighs the positive. The second section deals with being on two different sides where one has the mindset of &quot;WE&quot; and the other has the mindset of &quot;SELF.&quot;" />
