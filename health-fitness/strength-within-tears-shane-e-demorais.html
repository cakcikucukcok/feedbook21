  <title>Strength Within Tears - Shane E. DeMorais</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For some, the ability to cry when in emotional pain has been purposely forgotten. This is a practical step-step guide that when used correctly will bring about crying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also contained within are personal insights the author shares that were invaluable in unlocking the necessary human elements needed to accept ones vulnerability and let go into the tears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a boy Shane decided he would no longer cry for fear of appearing vulnerable. As he grew into manhood always searching for richer experiences, he realized that crying was a healthy way to release pain. Unfortunately, hed forgotten how and so whenever the need arose, anxiety took its place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later in life after a series of events took their toll, he gained the courage to let go of his youthful decision and purposely sought a means to induce the tears. This book marks the success of that search and of a notion that perhaps others were in need of a way back to the path of crying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the act of crying cannot simply be awakened if it has been asleep for a long time, key lessons in life have to be learned. These lessons came from Shanes search for inner peace which has led him down many paths such as the Martial Arts, a trip to India, Kundalini Meditation, Diamond Way Buddhist meditation, Acting, and Reiki, all under the guise of Software Engineer. These personal insights are noted to help the reader accept themselves and embrace their humanity thus giving them courage to let go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shane is currently living in the San Francisco Bay Area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His journey continues!&lt;/p&gt;" />
