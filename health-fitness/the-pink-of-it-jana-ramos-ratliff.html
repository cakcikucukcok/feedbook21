  <title>The Pink of It - Jana Ramos-Ratliff</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I can now say that I truly understand the meaning of we reap what we sow. You want to predict your future? Pay attention to your present, and let go of the past. But when we are so busy with everything else in life and forget to pay attention to how we are actually living our lives in the areas that matters the most (physically, emotionally, intellectually, and spiritually), life can be harsh and can teach us some important lessons. 
How to set back and go through those difficult times? How to understand why we have to go through certain things without losing it? No, you wont find all the answers for those questions in this book, but you will find what I did that helped me to go through breast cancer at the age of thirty-five and survive and be stronger than I was before. 
When I look back and read my journal, I am amazed by how much I accomplished during the treatment, considering what I went through. But the only thing that comes to my mind is that I couldnt have done everything alone. No matter where your faith is, you have to believe that you will make it and rely on those who are willing to help you. I believe that this was what got me to win this battle. Thank you to all who were in my life during that time." />
