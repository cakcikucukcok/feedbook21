  <title>Speak to Me, Lord, I’M Listening - Betsy Tacchella</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Throughout the Bible, God spoke to people, but does He still speak to us today? Through personal stories in &lt;i&gt;Speak to Me, Lord, Im Listening&lt;/i&gt;, you will gain fresh insight into how God communicates with us. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come along and hear how God spoke to me the day a fire threatened our home and again when we endured a mudslide. Enjoy His sense of humor as He spoke in the midst of a disastrous camping trip. Be encouraged by how He provided specific Scripture in the face of important decisions and wisdom regarding a sticky relationship. Experience the amazing words of hope and counsel He gave us regarding our sons college education. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Share in the unique words of comfort and support God gave me during my mothers trial with Alzheimers. Again, when my husband had a stroke, it was Gods personal direction that led to a miraculous event. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through stories, interspersed with biblical insights, you will find that our journey through life with Jesus is more than us talking to Him. It is also God speaking words of encouragement, comfort, and direction through Scripture, prayer, people, circumstances, dreams, visions, and His creation. Join me as we embark on an adventure of discovering and recognizing Gods voice. Lets listen and delight in hearing Him speak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me (John 10:27).&lt;/p&gt;" />
