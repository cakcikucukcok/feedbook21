      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The CrossFit superstar and author of the bestselling &lt;em&gt;The Badass Body Diet&lt;/em&gt; is back with a day-by-day guide designed to encourage habit change through fun, dynamic daily tasks challenging your mind, body, and spirit.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christmas Abbott knows the importance of a badass lifestyle; physically, mentally, and spiritually. The key is balance: using essential daily practices for the mind, body, and soul.&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;The Badass Life&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;is her month-long-program based on building positive daily habits, to help you achieve a higher quality of life and a heightened sense of self-worth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It takes 30 days to break a bad habit and 30 days to create a good one. Christmas provides a daily challenge for your mental, physical, and spiritual awareness to help you develop positive thinking and successful behavior and boost your brainpower.

Christmas also emphasizes the need for daily spiritual wellness, and gives you ideas for practicing intended acts of connection, such as helping a complete stranger unconditionally, setting specific intentions, and recording what you appreciate about yourself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No matter your level of health wellbeing, &lt;em&gt;The Badass Life&lt;/em&gt; will help you channel the power of the mind-body-spirit connection to become your best self in every way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Includes 32 pages of color photos.&lt;/p&gt;" />
