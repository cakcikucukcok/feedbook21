  <title>Completion of a Heart - Mr. Jaheem R. Hilts</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I wrote a book along time ago because I seen that it would be helpful to a lot of people in seeing simple and basic flaws with being truly committed in a relationship. The book touches on a range of topics on love and how it can fade away also on how it can be nurtured. With this book Im hoping to bring a change in current relationships and future relationships. The book isnt just compelled of information on relationships I put poetry in it too for those who like to travel into the beautiful essence of fantasy. I thought that writing a book showing mistakes of the past and the way people play with peoples feelings was a way to reverse the chances of it happening to somebody looking for sincerity. I used things from my own observation of different relationship experiences to referencing scriptures from religious practice. The book is very controversial also very informative. I knew when I wrote the book it would not be something people wouldnt like and something people would be able to broaden their perception or perspective off. I cant be quite sure how other people view the world in full I do assume with a great amount of understanding that the book Ive written can be discussed in groups and elaborate on the relationship topics. Its more than just a book to me its something I wanted to keep secret between me and one female so it can add more meaning to our relationship. I have yet to let anyone read the book in whole for my own protection. I feel now at this point I will love to share its value with the world. I hope to make a very interesting impact on all ages of people wanting to know about relationships and how just changing certain things about yourself; adding certain things to yourself can keep your relationship going where the fire never burns out or always lighting new fires." />
