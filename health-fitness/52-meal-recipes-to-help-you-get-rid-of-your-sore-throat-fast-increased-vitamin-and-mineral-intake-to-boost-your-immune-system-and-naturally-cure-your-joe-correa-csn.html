  <title>52 Meal Recipes to Help You Get Rid of Your Sore Throat Fast: Increased Vitamin and Mineral Intake to Boost Your Immune System and Naturally Cure Your - Joe Correa CSN</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Having a sore throat is an uncomfortable condition followed by irritation and swallowing difficulties.  Building your immune system through a variety of vitamin-rich foods is always the best way to fight off different viruses that causea sore throat and other illnesses. Most of us know this theoretically, but we don&#39;t seem to notice how important what we eat can be towards our recovery. We ignore or even completely avoid some basic nutritional guidelines, and fall into a trap and end up curing the condition instead of preventing it. This condition is not dangerous unless it lasts for an extended period of time and that&#39;s when you need to visit a doctor.  When dealing with a sore throat, eating can become painful but you need to eat to get better." />
