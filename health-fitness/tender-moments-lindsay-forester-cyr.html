  <title>Tender Moments - Lindsay Forester-Cyr</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Did you ever have someone in your life who made a negative impact on you? What about the person who made a positive impact and changed your life completely? This book helps guide parents, grandparents, teachers, and anyone who interacts with children how to leave a positive impact on their lives. You can help raise a child with Christian values, combining a healthy balance of being strict and giving them freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout my teaching experiences, I have had many parents ask advice on how to handle certain situations. Most of the same questions came from many different parents, so those questions are all answered in this book to help those who desire it. I encourage parents-to-be, or those who desire to be parents in the future, to read this book and get a head start!&lt;/p&gt;" />
