  <title>The Heart Disease Breakthrough: What Even Your Doctor Doesn&#39;t Know about Preventing a Heart Attack - Thomas Yannios</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What even your doctor may not know about the real heart attack risk factors and what you can do to prevent heart disease now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You count your cholesterol, monitor your fat and sodium consumption, and get regular exercise. But consider these facts: Many people who have heart attacks have cholesterol counts below 200. Low-fat diets can actually raise the heart attack risk in some people. And the wrong kind of exercise can do your heart more harm than good. Now for the good news: You can do something about it, and this book shows you how.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Recent research has revealed that the real risks are a combination of factors that you-and your doctor-may never have heard of, including the crucial differences between cholesterol types and much, much more. In The Heart Disease Breakthrough, Thomas Yannios, M.D., explains the state-of-the-art medical research and the science behind the latest breakthroughs in testing, diagnosis, nutrition, and exercise. And he presents a clear, easy-to-follow 10-step program for counteracting your individual risk factors and attaining optimum heart health.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;For those seriously concerned a with preventing heart disease, this is your guide: detailed, current, strongly worded guidelines. Yannios. . . isn&#39;t interested in cushioning the facts or the remedies in a feel-good framework. . . . Guidelines are set out here involving diet, weight control, exercise, and medication. Yannios doesn&#39;t let readers off easily, but that doesn&#39;t mean he can&#39;t offer realistic help: for instance, practically every cardiac risk factor can be countered by exercise; it just has to be the right type of exercise. Heart disease prevention is among the fastest-advancing medical research areas, with new, often conflicting recommendations being published daily. For those at serious risk, this is an understandable, serious, and worthwhile approach.&quot; - Kirkus Reviews" />
