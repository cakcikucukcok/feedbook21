  <title>Journeys - John Malek</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Every journey tells a story and every story has a meaning. Although my life would be filled with adventure, they were not always the escapades one might expect. Faced with the tasks of helping to raise my younger brother by day, the chores of an adult by night, and navigating through the emotional wreckage of a family tormented by psychological demons, I rarely experienced the joy of being a child.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Surviving endless attacks from bullies, the tyranny of parochial school, and abuse from sexual predators, I always believed in hope. Rejected at nearly every turning point in life, I ultimately discovered expectations that forever changed my future. Navigating the tumultuous seas of living, a new world had been revealed&amp;mdash;a world filled with promise surpassing my wildest dreams.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The boy once considered stupid, ignorant and insignificant, found love, hope, compassion, and his destiny. Without hope, none of this would have been possible.&lt;/p&gt;" />
