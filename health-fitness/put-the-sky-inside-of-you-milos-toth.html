  <title>Put the Sky Inside of You - Milos Toth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;A work that examines mysteries of life in an astute, concise manner.&quot; ~ Kirkus Review&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot; ...a philosophical novel about learning lessons over a lifetime. 
In the 1980s, Czechoslovakia&#39;s military service was required for men over the age of eighteen and spending two years in the austere training ground, known as a &quot;kasarne&quot;, wasn&#39;t seen as an enviable situation. The young men, usually aged between nineteen and twenty-two, &quot;felt deprived of their youth, deprived of chatting with girls, deprived of having the fun that an ordinary free life would otherwise offer to them.&quot;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Jirka and Jozef meet in a kasarne, and they form a bond as Jozef aids Jirka in writing love letters to his sweetheart, Margareta. However, the men&#39;s relationship is marked by jealousy. Who, after all, is the one truly winning over Margareta? Then, after a brief discussion of Einstein and the theory of relativity, the narrative shifts to detailing the life of a man named Julo, who&#39;s born in Czechoslovakia in 1961. But before much is revealed about him, readers find out that he ended up jumping to his death from a kitchen window. The question then becomes &quot;Why? Why did he jump?&quot; As the narrative details Julo&#39;s story, including such events as considering the purchase of a Skoda 105 automobile, serving his military requirement (during which he meets Jirka and Jozef), and mastering autogenous training relaxation techniques, readers know it&#39;s all destined to end in tragedy.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Although one may ascertain from the book&#39;s title that things will get dreamy, Toth instead keeps the plot developments grounded in the real world. It all culminates in a work that&#39;s realistic and contemplative, incorporating both love and tragedy while mingling youthful advice (such as the sentiment that a boy shouldn&#39;t &quot;run to catch bus or after a girl ...[I]n fifteen minutes another comes&quot;) with more abstract concepts (such as when Jirka wonders if the human brain has its own event horizon). Although some readers may not be won over by the characters&#39; contemplation, those who take an interest in Julo&#39;s experiences will likely want to see how they all come together-or, more accurately, given the character&#39;s suicide, how it all falls apart&quot; (Kirkus review).&lt;/p&gt;" />
