  <title>Banjaras - Sylvia Garib</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Take a seat in your comfortable armchair, and prepare for your journey from the sugarcane fields of northern Kwa Zulu Natal, South Africa to the saffron fields of Gopalpur, in Northern India. As you begin to read, you will wonder, where is this book leading to until you become so completely immersed, that you forget your cooling coffee. A Cant put it down book that you should definitely read. 
Banjaras  The story takes you from the arrival of the Indian indentured labourers from India, to the Colony of Natal in 1860, through to the birth of identical twins, Sella and Ree. 
Two couples, joined the migration of indentured labourers; one from the Moodley family, and the other from the Naicker family, from two different villages in South India. They arrived on different ships and were strangers to each other, but as the generations of these two couples evolved, the families became intrinsically linked, when in the fourth generation, a pair of identical twins were born, and separated at birth. 
The story follows the journeys of both twins; one of whom is lost in a stampede in India, and the other, adopted by a family in South Africa. The revelation of the reason, for the separation of the twins emerges eventually, propelling the one twin to fight all odds to find her lost twin sister. 
This fast-paced story traces the lives of each of the twins, and takes you across the vast Indian Ocean, to the distant and colourful land of India, where the twins are reunited. 
True to both their names, the girls were Banjaras, and floated through their lives like Free Spirits.
