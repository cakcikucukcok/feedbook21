  <title>Picking Up the Pieces without Picking Up: A Guidebook through Victimization for People in Recovery - Jennifer Storm</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&quot;Just when you thought recovery couldn&#39;t get any harder, life on life&#39;s terms happens, and sometimes that means someone perpetrating violence on you or your home.&quot;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;These words from the introduction of Jennifer Storm&#39;s newest book encapsulate a very real problem facing thousands in recovery today. Being victimized by crime can be a life-altering, traumatic experience-one that can potentially throw a person off the course of recovery and back into the throes of addiction. &lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Focus is on rebuilding one&#39;s life after the devastation of a crime or trauma, while preventing relapse and promoting healing and self-awareness. Through guided exercises, journaling, recovery reminders, and other helpful tools, readers will be empowered to move through their victimization with grace and strength. &lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Picking up the Pieces without Picking Up&lt;/EM&gt; offers a caring voice and expert guidance for those struggling with victimization and addiction, and also serves as a valuable resource for professionals in the treatment field, the criminal justice system, and the counseling arena.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;" />
