  <title>Dear Mary, Dear Luther - Jill Marie Snyder</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dear Mary, Dear Luther reveals through letters the emotional track of a 1930s courtship that leads to a lasting, loving marriage. 
Luther is the pursuer, always being honest with Mary about where she stands. Step by step, he proclaims his feelings as he progresses from attraction to love. The media often portray African American males as brutes, lacking feelings and deep emotions. Luthers authentic expressions of romantic love will be a revelation for many. 
Marysassy, feisty and mercurialis a very smart young lady. She continues to date others until Luther makes it clear she is the only one. She accepts his evolving emotional state, never pushing for a greater commitment than hes ready to make. 
It is wonderful to witness this couples burgeoning relationship over a period of three and one-half years. Gradually, their intimacy deepens until they reach a point when they both know theyre ready to become man and wife. These letters prove that a great love is attainable by everyone regardless of color or class.  We need only the courage to patiently let it bloom." />
