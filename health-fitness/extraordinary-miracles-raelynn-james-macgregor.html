  <title>Extraordinary Miracles - RaeLynn James-MacGregor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Im not sure how I got started thinking about this.   I had mixed emotions when my Aunt said to me, RaeLynn, you could write a book.  And it would sell!  Thanks, I think.  Up until that point, the thought had never crossed my mind.   I have had this nagging feeling that what Ive learned could help someone else.  Perhaps sharing my story would be the way to do that.  If I could help one person, it would be worth it.  I did motivational speaking for kids several years ago.  I wanted to help other kids that were in the same position as my kids were.  I couldnt protect my kids from the negative influences around them so I decided I needed to teach them how to protect themselves.  I wrote an introduction, kind of a come see me invitation when I was just getting started.  I stated by the time I knew I was a victim, I was already a survivor.  But it wasnt so easy for my kids.  And that was the honest to goodness truth.  I had no idea what I was doing. I had no idea what I had been through.  I guess I wasnt worried about me  I was worried about my kids.  Make no mistake  I know that what I went through and what my kids went through is nothing compared to what some women and kids go through.  Nor do I believe that any amount of abuse is okay.  Zero tolerance.  Enough said." />
