  <title>The Detrimental Effects of Emotional Abuse - Gunta I Krumins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Researcher, author stands up to Emotional Abuse &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gunta Krumins&lt;/strong&gt; presents the first comprehensive, non-clinical and educational guide exposing Emotional Abuse, a silent epidemic, as the foundation of all types of abuse that ascends simple yelling or verbal bullying and often culminates into Elder Abuse, another hidden issue. Explaining how to detect, expose and fight Emotional Abuse, the book ultimately creates a blueprint for stopping the cycle in our homes and communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intimately acquainted with the damaging costs of a manipulative relationship, and after years of reflection and a long-term behavioural study, Krumins presents the guide so readers can see beyond the veil of disguise and recognize the different levels and situations of Emotional Abuse. From a personal but professional point of view, she keeps an eye on the &amp;ldquo;big picture&amp;rdquo; as she revisits the subject of Emotional Abuse and Emotional Elder Abuse regarding issues of the true dangers of walking away from suspected situations of either, understanding how to identify situations involving either, intervention and the healing process for victims of abuse and what society can do together to help the victims and their families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is written for victims and families of victims of Emotional Abuse, such as Emotional Elder Abuse, who are seeking information on how to recognize and survive it, as well as for any professional who is trying to understand and manage these types of situations i.e. first responders (paramedics, police), elder/abuse advocacy centers, camps, schools, community centers, nursing homes, etc. It can also provide valuable insight for&amp;nbsp;governments, educational institutions, nursing colleges, medical programs, nursing homes, community centers, police, social agencies, legal profession, general public, financial institutions, etc. who are focused on enacting laws and implementing social policy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Individuals who prey upon the vulnerability of others do so in such a skilled way they are insusceptible to both suspicion and proof&amp;rdquo;, says Krumins. By recognizing the traits of abusers and trademarks of an Emotional Abuse situation, victims of abuse in an intimate relationship can be more easily recognized as it tears away the screen, opening the eyes of society to these tense living situations and giving revelation to victims living in fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About the Author:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gunta Krumins&lt;/strong&gt; lives in Canada and is the world&amp;rsquo;s foremost expert on Emotional Abuse, specializing in investigative research and case management of Emotional Elder Abuse cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drawing upon her past experiences, Krumins wrote &lt;em&gt;The Detrimental Effects of Emotional Abuse&lt;/em&gt; in order to end domestic violence and Emotional Elder Abuse. In her book, she relates to us how complicated and convoluted Emotional Abuse can be and helps us understand what motivates an abusive person and how they manage to conceal themselves and evade the law while destroying the lives of those they target. In order to manage either, one must first understand what Emotional Abuse truly is.&lt;/p&gt;" />
