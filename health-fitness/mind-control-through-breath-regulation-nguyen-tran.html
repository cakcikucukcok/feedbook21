  <title>Mind Control Through Breath Regulation - Nguyen Tran</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Mind control yoga cures many problems in life. It is straightforward to do, to enjoy short- and long-term benefits and natural spirituality. It is all laid out in the book including amusing 
humanistic and touching stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Book Reviews&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;At a time when the constant noise and haste of everyday life sends many in search of stillness and wellbeing, it may be surprising to find an approach to yoga written by a busy scientist. 
Here is a unique contribution to our scientific understanding of how yoga works on the mind and body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;Br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mind Control Through Breath Regulation can be used at many levels. Students and practitioners will find a delightfully illustrated guide to yoga exercises, and general hints on living 
healthily. Experienced practitioners can further their understanding and ways of developing the disciplined use of the breath. Those interested in science will find a fascinating study of the 
way neurones, electrical impulses and quantum energy are utilised in yoga practice to achieve high physical and mental potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;Br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an engineer who has practised yoga for over forty years, Nguyen Tran has broken new ground by using quantum physics to explain the bodys response to yoga. When Nguyen asked 
me to look at his work-in-progress, I offered to question, clarify, and help shape the expression of his ideas. Over time I have enjoyed the unfolding of his scientific approach to Yoga. His 
passion as a scientist and yoga practitioner, his story-telling, and his creative illustrations offer a unique contribution to curious practitioners and teachers of Yoga.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;
&lt;p&gt; - Christine Ingleton
BA, DipEd, BEd, MEd&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The book Mind Control through Breath Regulation contains amusing humanistic and touching stories and a new powerful form of  yoga, which makes reading enjoyable  and compelling . 
Echoing harmoniously through the Kundalini universe with quantum resonance, Dr Nguyen Trans mind control yoga techniques were fashioned out of very difficult, if not dire, life 
circumstances.  His technique is proof positive of the benefits of mind control yoga as a mind-spirit healing process.  Tran does not lay claim to insupportable facts, rather, his readers will 
judge for themselves how effective his methods are.   Offering a wealth of related benefits, this is a health guide tailor-fit for todays every man, woman, boy and girl.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;
