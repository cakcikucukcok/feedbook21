  <title>The Unweddables Among Us - Hank Flick Ph.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Speak up! (see 1 Peter 3:15-16; Colossians 3:16; Proverbs 31:89; 2 Timothy 3:16.) I am stepping up and speaking out to increase self-awareness and understanding for single men and women, divorcees, and widowers on the subject of romantic relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romantic relationships are an exciting part of life. Problems are inevitable. Relationships are hard to develop and even harder to maintain. To have a relationship, certain things must be present (see John 14:79). The goal in writing this book is to help adult singles understand and become more aware that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The single life is a good life, but its not always an easy life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Of the 100 million adult singles living in the United States, approximately 40 percent are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; unweddable. Meaning in their present state, they are unable, unwilling, unprepared, uninformed, or unrealistic when it comes to maintaining a romantic relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Romantic relationships pass through twelve steps. Only 5 percent of adult singles make it through all the steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Romantic relationships are not for every adult single at every point in their life.   These observations lead to the question: Why? The answers are within this book.&lt;/p&gt;" />
