  <title>How to handle a player in your relationship - Pharable</title>
      <meta name="description" content="If someone is showing bad behavior, you can stay, but if you&amp;#39;re looking for a healthy relationship, it&amp;#39;s better to say goodbye.&lt;br /&gt;
No one said it was easy to let go, but it was necessary.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;And the sooner you can do it, the less you can hurt yourself.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;I had to let the boys go before everything went well and we had a deep connection.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;But often, for some reason, because of my bad luck in the world, I have to give up the fact that they don&amp;#39;t live in the same city.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;I often think of her, believe me, but when the party is over, you shouldn&amp;#39;t be welcome for too long." />
