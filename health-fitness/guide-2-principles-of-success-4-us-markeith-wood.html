  <title>Guide 2 Principles of Success 4 Us - Markeith Wood</title>
      <meta name="description" content="GPS is an anology for mentoring. Guidance is given when the driver sets the coordinates. A lot of people dream small and move with little confidence. With GPS you gain confidence by believing what you have inside of you is greatness. When you understand the formula for success, and practice it, you win. It takes making a clear choice, a definite decision, developing yourself, and putting purpose to action. GPS directions.
It takes a village to raise a child. It takes a community to be involved with each other, and every child. That is a true community! Where is that now? Neighbors barely know each other!
From my point of view, we are separated, but together. We are different, but all the same. How do we live together productively, and respectfully? We have to find the mentoring connection within our circles.
Life is all about our relationships. Life is all about our stories, and the experience. 
The key is this . . . if you love yourself and work on yourself and do not accept failure as an ending, success is yours.
The GPS destination is that if you love yourself, develop yourself, and believe in the process, you will be successful." />
