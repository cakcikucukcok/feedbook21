  <title>Finding Your Peace Within the Chaos - Alexa Servodidio</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Alexa Servodidio, LCSW is the author of &lt;i&gt;Finding Your Peace Within the Chaos&lt;/i&gt; and Host on her radio show Insight into Healing. While preparing to write this book, Alexa decided to start each chapter with a question from her radio show. Her vision is to provide each reader with at least one educational tool for them to utilize and then share it with another. Giving back and paying it forward are the principles she bases her book, her show, and her life on. She wishes to thank everyone for joining her on this journey.  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Praise received for &lt;i&gt;Finding Your Peace Within the Chaos&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&quot;In her radio show and now in her book, Alexa brings to the forefront the challenges that people often suffer from in silence, including heroin addiction, anxiety, and domestic violence. Drawing from her vast experience as a therapist, she provides empathy, knowledge, and paths for change and healing.&quot;  &lt;br&gt;- Lauren Priday, MA, LCSW &lt;p&gt;&quot;My overall experience with Ms. Servodidio&#39;s book was excellent. I read the book in 2 days and could not put it down. For example, I am a social work student and this book really touched on poignant stories, and also focused on current issues and epidemics. She interviewed people, and made people aware of their stories and struggles. It also provided me ways to examine, use tools, and to think critically about future clients that I may come in contact with in the future. This is truly a very inspiring book and I am looking forward to a Part 2. I really found my peace within the chaos.&quot; &lt;br&gt;- Mary-Kay Kallergis  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;About the Author&lt;/u&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Alexa Servodidio is a Licensed Clinical Social Worker / Psychotherapist who has her own Private Practice.
