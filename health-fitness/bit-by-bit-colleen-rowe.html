  <title>Bit by Bit - Colleen Rowe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bit by Bit: reclaim meaning, purpose and pleasure in everyday life&lt;/em&gt; is part theory, part practical steps towards giving people the tools to live an engaging and fulfilling life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bit by Bit&lt;/em&gt; will appeal to people who live with a roller-coaster of emotions, energy or pain that affects everything they do (and don&amp;#39;t do); who have been blindsided by health problems or a major life event; or who simply feel that life is unsatisfying&amp;nbsp;and not what they had hoped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bit by Bit&lt;/em&gt; explores an occupational therapy approach to daily living. It examines the underlying proposition that what you actually do - or don&amp;rsquo;t do - each day is the product of a host of interactions, not all of which relate to your circumstances and capabilities. By exploring these interactions you will open up a whole new range of possibilities to help your day be more fulfilling, energising and inspiring. There are no quick fixes in this book &amp;ndash; positive change happens &lt;em&gt;Bit by Bit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using an umbrella analogy to explain the theory behind her approach, the author guides the reader to understand that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;to create change you don&amp;rsquo;t need new skills - you can change what you do and how you do things to get vastly different results.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;you can nurture and maintain positive change without it becoming overwhelming&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;you can temper your emotional reactions to life without expending huge amounts of energy to do so.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In writing this book, Colleen Rowe draws on her 30 years of experience and passion as an occupational therapist:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;I love that occupational therapy concentrates on the doing side of living. Life&amp;rsquo;s experiences and everyday challenges change over time &amp;ndash; often gradually and predictably; sometimes dramatically with no warning. My aim in writing this book is to lessen the impact these challenges impose on you, to find ways to enrich the valued aspects of your lifestyle.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She brings a unique blend of experience to this book, having worked with people across a broad spectrum of age and circumstances - in cities, country towns and remote communities; with people in acute care, rehabilitation, and who have fallen through the cracks of the health care system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are looking to build a more satisfying and enjoyable life, this is the book for you.&lt;/p&gt;" />
