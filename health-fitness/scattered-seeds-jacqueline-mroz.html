  <title>Scattered Seeds - Jacqueline Mroz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;As typical as donor-conceived children have become, with at least a million  such children in the US alone, their experiences are still unusual in many ways. In Scattered Seeds, journalist and writer Jacqueline Mroz looks at the growth of sperm donation and assisted reproduction and how it affects the children who are born, the women who buy and use the sperm to have kids, and the sperm donors who donate their genetic material to help others procreate. With empathy and in-depth analysis, &lt;em&gt;Scattered Seeds&lt;/em&gt; explores the sociology, psychology, and anthropology surrounding those connected with fertility procedures today and looks back at the history that brought us to this point.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The personal stories in this book will put a human face on the issues and help to illuminate this country&#39;s controversial and troubling unregulated fertility industry-an industry that has been compared to the Wild, Wild West, where anything goes. What is the human cost of our country&#39;s unregulated fertility industry? How are the lives of sperm-donor families changed? &lt;em&gt;Scattered Seeds&lt;/em&gt; will answer those questions, considering carefully the social and psychological dynamics surrounding those connected with fertility procedures today.&lt;/div&gt;" />
