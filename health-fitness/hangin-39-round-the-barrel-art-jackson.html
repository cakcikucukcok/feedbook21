  <title>Hangin&#39; Round the Barrel - Art Jackson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Im still trying to decide who I want to be when I grow up. I heard this statement one Saturday morning at a local meeting. The disturbing part was the individual who made the statement was in his sixties! He had completed 30 years of his life serving the government and had started a new career and yet had never decided what he was supposed to be doing. I think part of the problem was a lack of personal leadership. In all his years he had never applied the personal leadership strategies and tactics that allow the great among us to move through their lives with a great deal of purpose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leadership has been defined as getting others to do those things they would not normally or naturally want to do. Individual leadership is getting yourself to do those things you would not normally or naturally want to do. Once we learn and apply the same personal leadership habits that have been used by statesmen, generals and leaders of all walks of life throughout history, we find that life becomes more challenging but also more fulfilling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through Hangin Round The Barrel, readers will learn the Purpose Centered Leadership process, which allows them to effectively pursue their intended level of greatness. They will learn to implement time proven methods that will increase their performance in their personal lives, their professional lives and their public lives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through Hangin Round The Barrel, readers will learn to: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Manifesting their intended level of greatness; &lt;br /&gt;
2. Remain centered during constant change and turmoil; &lt;br /&gt;
3. Examine their attitudes that keep them from manifesting their intended level of greatness; &lt;br /&gt;
4. Gain an understanding of how calling and vocation can work together to provide an incredible performance and &lt;br /&gt;
5. Develop and implement a plan for greatness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Readers will develop leadership practices that will: &lt;br /&gt;
increase personal effectiveness; &lt;br /&gt;
provide a clear picture of who they are, how they behave and why you do so, and &lt;br /&gt;
how to create results for themselves and others. &lt;/p&gt;
