  <title>Skin Cleanse - Adina Grigore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Breakouts. Dryness. Redness. Oiliness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you&#39;re like most women,&lt;/em&gt; you&#39;ve been on a never-ending quest for perfect skin&amp;#8212;or even just good skin&amp;#8212;since adolescence. It&#39;s a frustrating pursuit to say the least, filled with one disappointing (and expensive) miracle solution after another. Why is it so hard to get good skin?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adina Grigore, founder of the organic skincare line S.W. Basics, would argue that getting clear, calm, happy skin is about much more than products and peels. Or, rather, it&#39;s about much less. In Skin Cleanse, she guides readers through a holistic program designed to heal skin from the inside out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We tend to think of our skin as a separate entity from the rest our bodies when in fact it is our largest organ. The state of our skin is a direct reflection of what our bodies look like on the inside. So Adina&#39;s program begins as any healthy regime should: with the basics for full-body health. That means eating plenty of fresh, whole foods; drinking more water; getting blood pumping and oxygen flowing to your cells through movement; and giving your skin a chance to repair and regenerate by resting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From there, readers are challenged to a skin cleanse that requires going product-free for twenty-four hours. Once detoxed, Adina then shows us how to overhaul our beauty routine, how to carefully add some products back in, and even how to make our own products at home, with advice and targeted solutions for specific skin conditions such as acne, dry skin, oily skin, and more.The secret to beautiful, stress-free skin is simple: it&#39;s an inside job.  &lt;/p&gt;" />
