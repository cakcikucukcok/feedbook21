  <title>Confessions of an English Opium-Eater - Thomas de Quincey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;quot;Confessions of an English Opium-Eater&amp;quot; is an autobiographical narrative by English author Thomas De Quincey. First published in The &lt;i&gt;London Magazine&lt;/i&gt; in two parts in 1821, then as a book, with an appendix, in 1822.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
De Quincey&amp;rsquo;s rather majestic, classically learned and singular style inspires every page of his writing. His &amp;quot;Confessions of an English Opium-Eater&amp;quot; guarantees him a place in this series as a writer whose life and writing were equally expressive of an unquenchable originality of thought and behaviour. The highly poetic and imaginative prose of the &lt;i&gt;Confessions&lt;/i&gt; makes it one of the enduring stylistic masterpieces of English literature.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The avowed purpose of the first version of &amp;quot;Confessions of an English Opium-Eater&amp;quot; was to warn the reader of the dangers of opium, and it combined the interest of a journalistic expos&amp;eacute; of a social evil, told from an addict&amp;rsquo;s point of view, with a somewhat contradictory and seductive picture of the subjective pleasures of drug addiction. The book begins with an autobiographical account of the author&amp;rsquo;s addiction. It then describes in effective detail the euphoric and highly symbolic reveries that he experienced under the drug&amp;rsquo;s influence and recounts the horrible nightmares that continued use of the drug eventually produced.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Athough De Quincey ends his narrative at a point at which he is drug-free, he remained an opium addict for the rest of his life. In 1856 he rewrote &amp;quot;Confessions of an English Opium-Eater&amp;quot; and added descriptions of opium-inspired dreams." />
