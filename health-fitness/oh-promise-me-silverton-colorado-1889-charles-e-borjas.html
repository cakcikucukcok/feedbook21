  <title>Oh Promise Me ( Silverton, Colorado 1889) - Charles E. Borjas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The aspiring adventures of a young man from Texas who moves to the mining town of Silverton, Colorado in hopes of striking it rich by owning his own mining company. A college graduate, his intelligence and skill makes room for him. However, his skills as a former soldier also find a place of opportunity when the deputy sheriff is killed in a gunfight. His instincts compel him to rush to the Sheriff&#39;s aid, and in doing so unwittingly finds himself being introduced to the sheriff&#39;s daughter. 
The future begins to look bright until his world is disrupted by rowdy cowboys, renegade Indians and claim jumping bamboozlers. There is much to overcome before he realizes his dream, his real dream, the love of his life.
Mack is faced with a decision to choose between one of two lives; the life of a lawman, or the life of a mining company owner. He has to deal with a woman who loves him, her father and mother, avalanches and drunken miners, land barons, and his own over-enthusiasm to make it big in a turbulent town." />
