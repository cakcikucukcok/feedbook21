  <title>SMART Practice - Jeff Scheetz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have anything in your life you would like to get better at? Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s a new challenge, or maybe it&amp;rsquo;s something you have struggled with trying to master in the past. Whatever it is, the only way to see real improvement in anything is with a systematic way to practice it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SMART Practice was developed to allow anyone to maximize their efforts in improving their skill. Being efficient and effective with how you work on your skill will move you forward and keep you from getting frustrated and wanting to quit. If you look back on anything you have given up on in the past, it was most likely due to not having a good system to keep you on track!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SMART Practice helps you; assess where you are, determine what you need to do next, schedule your time in a unique and powerful way with the SMART Zone schedule, drill down on anything with the 5 SMART steps, and learn to use the &amp;ldquo;Four R Circle&amp;rdquo; to help you track and review what you are working on.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There have been a ton of books that delve deep into the idea that talent can be &amp;ldquo;nurtured,&amp;rdquo; but they usually stop short of giving you a system to help you nurture yours! SMART Practice shows you a step by step system that gives you guidance and clear direction to take your skill to the next level. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you have something you want to get better at, SMART Practice is simply the best way to get there.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
