  <title>Gentle Breeze of Daily Wisdom: Aphorisms and Thoughts for Daily Wisdom and Personal Growth - Anil Kumar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Warning! This book will remind you that we are spirit beings masquerading as humans. The author believes that the modern man is so caught up in making a living that he has no time to truly and deeply think about life - where he&#39;s come from and where he&#39;s heading. His shallow living with murky intentions, self-centeredness and compulsion to perpetually engage in social networking, so as not to feel isolated, leave no time or energy for him to think at a deeper level. The result is frustration, confusion and inner conflict. And what is inside is experienced outside. There is clearly a need to genuinely create the feeling of being connected with fellow humans from a level where we all come together. In this compendium of pithy statements and aphorisms the author has encapsulated thought provoking and motivational wisdom to take the reader&#39;s mind from thinking too many thoughts at one time to focusing the mind each day on the bigger questions about true self, the spirit within and purposeful life to promote inner growth and peace." />
