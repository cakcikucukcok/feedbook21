  <title>Be Your Own Beautiful - Devin Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Be Your Own Beautiful ~ is a book dedicated to inspiring women of all ages and nationalities to always find the beauty within themselves while learning to love who they are. It is important that, as women, we face our insecurities so that we are able to embrace the fullness of our purpose and who God originally destined us to be. Being a woman who has struggled most of my life with anger, it became important to me to find the root of this anger because it had turned me into a person that many people didnt want to be around, including myself. I chose to share my story because I desire to help as many young ladies/women break free from the pain of their past while embracing the Rare Beauty that awaits within. Once that Rare Beauty is found, I guarantee you will realize that YOU are not an illusion of beauty but the definition of it." />
