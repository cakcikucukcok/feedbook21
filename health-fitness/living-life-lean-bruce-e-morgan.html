      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-More than two thirds of Americans are overweight, over one third are obese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-43% of Americans are projected to be obese in 10 years time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Nearly one third of children and adolescents are overweight, 17% are obese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Since 1980, obesity prevalence among children and adolescents has almost tripled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Between 1988 and 2008 the prevalence of obesity among adults increased at all income and education levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-After smoking, obesity is Americas leading cause of premature death and is linked to 70% of heart disease and 80% of diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-In 2008 the medical costs associated with obesity were estimated to be $147 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
