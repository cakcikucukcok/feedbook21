  <title>How to Help the One You Love - Brad Lamm</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;As a thorough guide to helping substance abusers find help, this makes a valuable addition to the self-help shelves.&quot;--&lt;i&gt;Publishers&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Weekly&lt;/i&gt; (starred review)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A powerful, groundbreaking book that shows you, in concrete steps, how to help a loved one stop from engaging in self-destructive behavior.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is your husband drinking himself to death? Is your brother losing it all to gambling? Do you need to get your kid off drugs before it&#39;s too late? Or make your spendthrift sister stop maxing out her credit cards? Get your best friend out of an abusive relationship? If you&#39;re tired of watching your spouse, child, relative, or friend go downhill, dragging you with them, &lt;i&gt;How to Help the One You Love &lt;/i&gt;will help you turn their lives around. You don&#39;t have to endure behavior that is unhealthy, abusive, or even deadly. You can break down the great myths around change--and help them change for good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many books will tell you that you can&#39;t change anyone. They advise you to not even try. But they ignore the tremendous power you actually have to change people. If most books about change are written for the person in trouble, &lt;i&gt;How to Help the One You Love &lt;/i&gt;reaches out to the loved ones: people who know that change is critical and urgent. &lt;i&gt;How to Help the One You Love &lt;b&gt;is not just a self-help book; it&#39;s a help-you-act book.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Brad Lamm&#39;s book is a must-read for those seeking help!&quot;--Nancy Grace, host of the &lt;i&gt;Nancy Grace &lt;/i&gt;show on CNN&lt;/p&gt;" />
