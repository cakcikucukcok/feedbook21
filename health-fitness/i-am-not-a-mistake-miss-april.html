      <meta name="description" content="Your self esteem is one of the most invaluable things you have.  This is your life and you must live it according to your principles, values, and worth.  If you are not sure what they are, this would be an awesome time to learn.  Self esteem begins with you.  A healthy self esteem is vital for your survival in the real world.  There are a lot of people who say they love themselves and they really don&#39;t but it sounds good so they go with it.  Don&#39;t be this person!  You must go deeper than that.  You have to Speak It, Believe It, &amp; Receive It!    If you don&#39;t believe it there is no reason to speak it.  You can&#39;t receive anything until you believe it.  Think before you speak because it could save you in the long run.  Actions speak louder than words so always be on the lookout.  Always remember that no matter what situation, journey, test, trial, or tribulations you may have, you must not give up because you have to follow your dreams, passions, and desires. Always remember that you are not a mistake and you are here for a purpose." />
