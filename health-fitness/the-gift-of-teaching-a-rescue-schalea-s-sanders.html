  <title>The Gift of Teaching: A Rescue - Schalea S Sanders</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Everyone thought she lived a privileged life. Schalea Sanders was a model student. She was polite and well-mannered and excelled in every aspect of her studies. But Schalea hid a dark secret masked by good grades and a powerful last name: she endured a home life of violence and chaos that did not match her seemingly perfect exterior. Engulfed by dysfunction and turmoil at home, she found school her only sanctuary&amp;mdash;a place of normalcy where the otherwise broken teenager was encouraged, validated, and loved. But when home life and school life began to collide and stress sabotaged her studies, Schalea could barely breathe. She was drowning. Unlike the stories of many children who suffer abuse, Schalea&amp;rsquo;s has a happy ending. Through the support of not just one, but many caring educators, Schalea pulled herself out of a life that threatened to destroy her to become the successful woman, wife, mother, educator, and entrepreneur she is today. The gift of teaching rescued her. In an age when the controversy surrounding standardized testing and teacher evaluations has stolen much of the joy from our classrooms, The Gift of Teaching is a reminder that there is no rubric to measure the impact a caring and inspired teacher can have on a child. Let it inspire you to peek behind the mask of a polite smile and share your gift of teaching. What child in your classroom&amp;mdash;or in your life&amp;mdash;needs the gift of your teaching? Every parent and educator needs to read this powerful book! The Gift of Teaching is not merely one woman&amp;rsquo;s story; it is a journey.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
