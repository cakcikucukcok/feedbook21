  <title>Sassy, Classy and Smart: the Path to Total Self Confidence - Phyllis McNeal</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I am writing this for every woman! As a woman, you should feel loved, special, and treasured. Many of us do not feel that way because we do not think of ourselves that way. We should shine our light on ourselves! Each of us is like a beautiful flower. When you look at a garden, it is beautiful because of the variety you see. You see the reds and the oranges, the yellows, and the pinks. Even those flowers of the same variety have a variation in themselves. Without the variety, it would lack interest and not be as beautiful to enjoy.
Women are like the flowers. We are tall, short, blond, brunette, and many, many varieties. We are meant to be treated with the same care that we would give the flowers that we enjoy.
I always treat myself to flowers, and my dining room table always graces a variety of blooms. I most certainly enjoy them, but I always give them the best of care. I make sure they have clean water and a beautiful vase to display their beauty. We need to give ourselves the same delicate care. It is about the enjoyment of you!
I would love for every woman to love herself enough and cherish her femininity. Enjoy you! Loving you is the beginning of others loving you. Nothing makes a woman more beautiful than the belief that she is beautiful." />
