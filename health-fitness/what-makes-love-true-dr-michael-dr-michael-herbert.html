  <title>What Makes Love True? - Dr. Michael Dr. Michael Herbert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a book that can reach any person. It is a simple truth about what seems to be a complicated subject. By using these points it will cultivate deepen and develop a bond and emotion in the relation of love. This study was designed for frequent referencing when needing a reminder of what is love. It is my hope that reading this book will elevate the mind and the heart to put these facts about love to the test and ill enhance all other studies one might have on this subject.
Love is a commitment to responsibility and the responsibility to commit. There is an unending supply of manuscripts depicting love. Could it be that there is someone else writing about love? After all, with all of the printed information about love, is there a need for or even room for one more thought concerning the subject of What Is Love?
This book evolves from tragic circumstances. It is an attempt to give real meaning to the question, what is love? By no means am I trying to say that this is the only revelation of love, or the only answer to the question. What I wanted to communicate to the reader or the listener is that there are some absolutes that are real and tangible regarding the meaning of love. 
The ten points being made in this book are brought from the Bible and can be practiced by Christians and non-Christians alike. That is because the principles apply to both Christians and non-Christians. They are like laws that govern relationships. I had listed a few more than these ten points but I felt that the points in this book were the most important ones, and they covered a broader perspective. 
Each chapter has been divided into five sections. The first section is the defining point. The second section provides scriptural references from a biblical text for the point being made. The third section has a discussion that is explained in a few paragraphs. The fourth section is an applied marriage application, hopefully able to be applied to todays marriages. And last but not least the fifth section is a question and answer section. The section ends with a discussion for the husband and the wife to participate in, and also includes a thought for the single person to ponder.
It is my sincerest desire that after reading this thesis that the question of what is love can be answered, and that there will be a complete satisfaction that needs no further investigation." />
