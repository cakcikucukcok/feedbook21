  <title>Caregiving for Beginners - Frank&#39;s Wife</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When my husband was first diagnosed with a rare form of dementia, I was devastated. My world was crumbling around me, and I was helpless to stop it. Sympathetic doctors and friends gave me handouts, books, and scary information. I could have used a book like this then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goal is to help those facing a similar diagnosis (Alzheimers and other dementias). Ive included some unique skills and hints for living day to day with this debilitating disease. I have advice on finances, clothing, traveling, and hygiene. I also encourage readers to develop their own creative skills to care for their loved ones and themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I can help just one person get through this challenge in their lives, I will have succeeded in my efforts.&lt;/p&gt;" />
