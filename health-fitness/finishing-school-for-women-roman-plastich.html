      <meta name="description" content="The smallest things can create tension. If you have an argument, you might have been taught never to go to bed angry, and he might have been taught to sleep on it because after rest the brain is more rational.

Clashes in personalities can be enough to make a couple miserable after many years of compromising and giving in. Yes, you may go through rough times sometimes, but dont you think you would choose to be with someone because you are happier with that person in your life than you would be on your own? Women have a right to have their needs fulfilled, to receive affection from a man, to receive as much love as they give.
Many relationships turn into a struggle for power, but it doesnt have to be that wayfor men or women. In this guidebook geared for women but useful for anyone, you can learn how to find common ground with your partner. But to do so, you first need to know what youre really seeking in a relationship.
By examining what motivates yourself and your partner, youll be equipped to answer critical questions:
	If youre single, should you try meeting people in person 
	or online?
	Why in the world would someone cheat if he or she 
	has a loving partner?
	How can you fix a 
	broken relationship?
	When is it time to abandon 
	a partner?
Too often, instead of working toward a common goal, people avoid doing what they dont want to do, and they lose out on having a real partner. But when you find a true teammate, youll be more satisfied with life and better equipped to accomplish your goals.
