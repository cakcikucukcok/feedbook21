  <title>Time Management: Making Your Time Count! - Anthony Ekanem</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Do you find yourself rushing through your morning, stampeding to the door, making your way through traffic only to arrive 10 minutes late for work because you had to wait for the train? How does the rest of your day go?   Once you get yourself into work, do you need to take a few moments to compose yourself? Perhaps you get a coffee and relax by chatting with a co-worker on your way to your desk. You forgot the morning meeting! So you start rifling through your papers.  Regardless of whether you work at home, in an office or in a factory, or whether you work for a boss or yourself, getting a grip on time seems like a daily struggle for millions of people.  While every dollar has the same value, every hour does not. An hour at 10:00 in the morning may be of much more value as a working hour than 11:00 at night. On the other hand, an hour at your child&#39;s bedside when he is sick is worth more than an hour at the office catching up on your filing.  Read this book to learn how to manage time effectively." />
