  <title>The Great Body Bible - The Fitness Wizards</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Finally we had realised that our fitness and nutrition habits worked in the rest of our lives also and are now able to show good habits to our circle of influence across the whole of our lives. It is never too late to make that lasting impression, not with loud words but with worthy actions. . Appearing perfect is not the example to set, being human and accepting responsibility for your life is far worthier. &lt;br /&gt;You can be whatever you want to be, though at times you may find that hard to believe. Life is too short to live through it being any less than the best that you can be. Imagine yourself in one year: how would you like to look and feel? Are you fit, strong, confident, proud, and healthy? Are you the perfect role model for all of the people who know you? Are you working towards these goals right now, or are they just wishes and hopes for the future? If your dreams seem far away or unrealistic, you can bring them into your reality right now, in this very moment, by making a commitment to change the way you think and thus change your life. We wrote this book for you, to provide the simple guidelines that you need to coach and attain your dream body, health, and fitness, and to become an ideal role model for everyone that knows you. &lt;br /&gt;Our job is to show you how you can have the body, fitness, health, and peace of mind you crave. You can become the star in your own life performance. We will tell you exactly what has worked for us. We will share our potent habits, and you can choose which you can use in your life. &lt;br /&gt;Your job is to make a commitment to yourself to undergo the coaching process, become your own coach, and be ready to accept with an open mind any new ideas and the new you. &lt;br /&gt;Your life is an amazing journey, so get enthusiastic about your future and generate some real excitement  you have everything to gain. Become your own biggest fan, because self-belief is potent magic  Bodymagic!&lt;/p&gt;" />
