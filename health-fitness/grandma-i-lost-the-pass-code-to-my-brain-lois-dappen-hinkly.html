  <title>&quot;Grandma, I Lost the Pass Code to My Brain!&quot; - Lois Dappen Hinkly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Grandma, I Lost the Pass Code to My Brain (and God is not helping me)!  These are the exact words my six year old granddaughter said to me at the end of a really bad day.  She was feeling disconnected from who she was and what she was capable of achieving at that moment in her life.  She had lost her sense of ease within herself.  Fortunately, through my experience teaching in public schools for 30 years, taking a wide variety of classes, and starting a business focusing on fun ways to learn about yourself  I knew what to say to her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My granddaughter is not alone. Many of us can feel lost or overwhelmed by daily events.  It is time to share what Ive learned with other caretakers of todays children:  parents, teachers, and leaders.  In this book, the Nine Keys for Better Tomorrows help address issues that keep children and adults from reaching their potential, achieving their purpose, and finding fulfillment in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will learn how to:  
*Raise your listening, thought, emotion and energy INTELLIGENCES.
*Build self esteem, stop invalidation, and know you matter.
*Uncover your (and your childrens) self preferences through the science of numbers using birth dates and given names at birth.
*Find out about the seasons of life through the Nine Year Cycle theory.
*Learn from natural teachers:  animals, fairy tales, cultural characters, color, and planets- so you, too, can build better tomorrows.&lt;/p&gt;" />
