  <title>Mentors&#39; Glory - Lorraine M. Plante, David E. Plante</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ones teen years are often difficult. And when a teenager leaves homeno matter the reasonit can be more than difficult. It can be dangerous. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Mentors Glory, fifteen-year-old Jacob leaves his home in Rochester, New Hampshire, in 1957 to find summer employment. Authors David E. Plante and Lorraine M. Plante take readers on Jacobs journey as he hitchhikes down the Eastern Seaboard. Hitching rides make Jacob a conspicuous target for the perverted, and an incident in Georgia almost leads to more than he can handle. He survives the summer adventure only because his protector, Christ, is actively involved in his life and provides Jacob with mentors to guide and help him in spite of his navet. As he matures from an independent and strongwilled teenager to a young man with a family, Jacob once again finds himselfthis time with family in towon the road, looking for a job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mentors Glory, the sequel to Kids Dont Build Boats, tells the real-life story of a young man in search of himself. While he faces danger along the way, Jacob is confident of his safety because he relies on Gods promise to never leave nor forsake him. Included in Gods special gift s to Jacob are timely mentors who provide sanctuaries, employment, and advice as he continues his search for a meaningful, productive life. &lt;/p&gt;" />
