  <title>Treat Yourself Natural: Over 50 Easy to Make Natural Remedies for Mind and Body - Sof McVeigh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is a source book for mind, body and soul, as well as a testament to the natural power and beauty of herbs. Overflowing with ideas from the pretty to the practical, this book contains many projects that use the gardener&#39;s bounty throughout the seasons. Our gardens contain much of what we need to keep mild ailments at bay and it&#39;s fun giving it a go - instead of nuking the dandelions in your lawn - pick them and use them. Or plant marigolds, not just for their cheerful colour, but to make wonderful skin oils with them. You&#39;ll find recipes for invigorating body scrubs, relaxing bath salts and just plain fun bath bombs. Also tips for what to look for in your garden or home that can be used to make health-giving tonics or soothing balms, and take a leaf out of the wisdom of country lore (along with new research that shows much of what they were talking about made sense) and put it to use for mild ailments. Whether you want to give something practical for the home, indulgent to enjoy at bathtime, or to complement a delicious dinner, there is a present that will suit everyone.&lt;/p&gt;" />
