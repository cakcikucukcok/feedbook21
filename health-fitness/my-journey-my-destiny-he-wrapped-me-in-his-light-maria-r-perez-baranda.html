  <title>My Journey / My Destiny He Wrapped Me in His Light - Maria R. Perez-Baranda</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;All of a sudden, it hit me: while I am waiting on the Lord to work in my life; the Lord is waiting on me. This was the moment in time for me to share His message of love for us, through my own personal journey. Ive stepped out in faith to share with others of his amazing grace. Thank you, Father God all glory, honor and praise, I give onto your precious holy name. Im getting it! Im sitting here with a great big smile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dont know how the story of my life is going to end, but I know the one that does. On that note, I send blessings to all the women of faith, along with those who are and will become pillars of strength for their families. God is ever so faithful, and he does have a sense of humor; see how he, our heavenly Father, works all things out for good for those who believe. Be still and know that God is still God; He is mighty in working miracles and wonders! He is still our healer, and He wants to show Himself strong on behalf of those who trust in Him. Keep believing and never give up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While reading, you will be drawn into a life journey filled with lots of love and laughter, as well as tragic losses. You will find golden nuggets of wisdom, faith, courage, loss and victory sprinkled throughout. My Journey My Destiny, He wrapped Me in His Light is a source of encouragement, not only to single mothers, but to all women who have struggled with the loss of a loved one, have had health issues, been unemployedbut never lost hope, and how you can become an unshakeable women of faith!&lt;br /&gt;
