  <title>There&#39;s a Light Within You That Never Goes Out - Tiffany L. Werhner Ms Lmhc Pa</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Throughout her journey as a Psychological Specialist in Correctional Facilities and in Private Practice, she had some clients that survived severe and horrifying rapes and childhood sexual abuse and incest. Some of the clients that confided in her she could not even believe were still alive. Years of TORTURE, RAPE, and ABUSE. So she started documenting with their permission. She held a private Survivor Group and they have all come so far in their journeys of recovery. One of her clients has a similar story to the Penn State Sandusky case (as a victim) and the pedophile has been arrested. She is a strong believer in standing up for what you believe so you can encourage other victims to receive courage to do the same. Completing this book as well as watching her group evolve as they completed their empowerment assignments has been a journey for her. The actual stories of the victims are included in this book. The guided therapeutic assignments given to the group, as well as their non-edited testimonies, assignments, and disclosures are also included. 
One specific clients childhood was nothing but horrifying incestual torture. She thinks that this book, when published, may be her purpose that God made me go through years of suffering...I finally see that God loved me and made me have a special purpose... This book is something that will not only grab your attention, but hopefully encourage the public to take the stigma AWAY from seeking professional mental health help. It is never too late to seek help. There is no shame in seeking to find the light within you that never goes out." />
