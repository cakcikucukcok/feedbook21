  <title>Relentless Pursuit - Nathan Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Relentless Pursuit is a game changer. This is a book that offers tactical warfare and hand to hand combat detail and solutions for thriving commercial real estate practice leaders and their teams. Relentless Pursuit is about sifting through the overwhelming amount of information on how to be a successful Project Manager and understanding which tasks matter most. Relentless Pursuit refined all of that overwhelming information and gives you very focused strategies that if executed will deliver all the results. It’s about getting BIGGER RESULTS, BIGGER SUCCESS, and BIGGER REWARDS by relentlessly breaking through the clutter and focusing on the vital few. Author Nathan Brown is a young commercial real estate Project Manager based in Dallas, one of the hottest and most competitive markets on the planet, and he’s quickly taking the industry by storm. Having worked with some of the largest and most prestigious companies around the world, Nathan quickly realized one common denominator between them all, almost every Project Manager felt overwhelmed by the huge amount of “Best Practice” information given to them. The Answer? This Book. Sort through the masses of information, work with other best in class real estate professionals to refine the material, then study actual projects to see which task are Musts, which are Shoulds, and which are just busy work. Nathan uses the exact strategies and approach laid out in this book on every project he manages, which has allowed him to deliver over $1.5B of real estate development and construction projects of all types from coast to coast with unparalleled results, all the while with a workload 25% - 100% larger than other top-tier Project Managers." />
