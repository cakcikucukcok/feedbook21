  <title>Happy Wives Club - Fawn Weaver</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; Bestseller!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One woman undertakes a worldwide search to learn the secrets of a great marriage&amp;mdash;and finds one foundational truth that could change everything.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fawn Weaver was a happily married woman running a successful business&amp;mdash;and then something happened. Maybe it was divorce rate reports on the evening news, &lt;em&gt;The Real Housewives of Orange County&lt;/em&gt;, or any daytime talk show where husbands and wives dramatically reveal their betrayals. Everywhere she looked, Fawn saw negative portrayals of marriage dominating the airwaves and dooming everyone to failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Looking at Keith, the love of her life, she knew that wasn&amp;rsquo;t true. She was determined to find and connect with women just like her&amp;mdash;happy and optimistic about marriage, deeply in love with her spouse, and committed to building a strong marriage that stands the test of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;On a whim,she started the blog HappyWivesClub.com and sent the link to a few of new friends. What started as a casual invitation to five women exploded into an international online club with 150,000 members in more than 100 countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Happy Wives Club&lt;/em&gt; is Fawn&amp;rsquo;s journey across the world to meet her friends and discover what makes their marriages great. Join her on this exciting, exotic trip across six continents and through more than eighteen cities. Walk the streets of Mauritius, the historic ruins in Italy, and the vistas of New Zealand and Australia. Go from Cape Town to London, Manila to Buenos Aires, Winnipeg to Zagreb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Along the way, you will meet everyday women whose marriage secrets span cultures. You will hear their stories, witness their love, and be inspired by the proof that happy, healthy marriages do exist&amp;mdash;and yours can be one of them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;It turns out great marriages are all around us&amp;mdash;when we look for them. Go on a trip with Fawn and learn the best marriage secrets the world has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;" />
