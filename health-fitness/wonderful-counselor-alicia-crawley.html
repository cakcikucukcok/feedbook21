  <title>Wonderful Counselor - Alicia Crawley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In February 2008, Alicia Crawley got the phone call every parent dreads: two of her children had been in a car accident. Her son, Jonathan, was fine, but by the time Alicia arrived at the scene minutes later, her sixteen-year-old daughter, Lauren, had died. In the days that followed, Alicia, who until then had had a vibrant relationship with Jesus Christ, was plunged into the dark pit of grief, unable even to feel Gods presence. His seeming silence left her spiritually paralyzed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alicia barely recognized herself or her life, but she kept going to Gods word, seeking comfort, understanding, and purpose. She came to realize that He had never left her but that she hadnt been able to hear Him over the roar of her pain. Deeply thoughtful, honest, and unafraid to ask difficult questions, Alicia shares here what she learned about suffering, about heaven, and about listening to and trusting God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although support groups, individual therapy, and medication can all help at a time of profound loss, &lt;i&gt;Wonderful Counselor &lt;/i&gt;assures us that the Holy Spirit is the ultimate source of wisdom and healing. For Alicia, turning to God provided more than comfort; it oriented her family toward the future and toward opportunities to reach the lost and broken around them in ways and in places they never could have imagined. Surrendering their beloved Lauren took on meaning they never thought possible. Guided by the Spirit, they have allowed her legacy to become one of hope and joy.&lt;/p&gt;" />
