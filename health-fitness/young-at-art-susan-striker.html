      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From the creator of the bestselling &lt;i&gt;Anti-Coloring Book&lt;/i&gt; series with more than 600,000 copies sold, a new parenting guide to encouraging creativity in preschool-age children&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Young at Art &lt;/i&gt;is the first and only comprehensive book for the general audience about the nature, value and impact of art on very young children.  Directed towards parents and educators of one to five year olds, Susan Striker explains why children&#39;s art is not a frill, but the very foundation upon which all later fundamental skills are built. She drives home the idea that encouraging children&#39;s artistic growth will have beneficial effects on all other aspects of their emotional and intellectual development. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the core of this practical guide is the understanding that art is an important tool in teaching young children crucial concepts related to self-expression, reading and writing. As opposed to more structured exercises, such as coloring on dittos and underlining pictures in workbooks, Striker stresses that scribbling and free drawing experiments are the most important art activities a child can engage in; they better prepare children to read independently as they grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Young at Art&lt;/i&gt; provides descriptions for age-appropriate art activities, tips for carrying them out safely, and helps parents recognize what a child&#39;s art work should look like at each stage of development.  With &lt;i&gt;Young at Art&lt;/i&gt;, parents will develop realistic expectations of their children&#39;s work, learn how to speak to their children about their art, and  facilitate skills well beyond their creativity that will benefit children.&lt;/p&gt;" />
