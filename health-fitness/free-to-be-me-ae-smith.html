  <title>Free to Be Me - Ae Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Free To Be Me is an expression about being free mind, body and spirit. This book is dear and close to my heart. I am so thankful to God for allowing me to be used and heard in this hour for such a time as this. It is my prayer with great sincerity  that every reader can open up their heart to be totally healed, delivered, and SET FREE. The bible says in John 8:36 If the son therefore shall make you free, you are free indeed KJV. Some have been called to teach, preach, to be a nurse, doctor, lawyer, sunday school teacher, church secretary, caretaker of the elderly, CEO of a company and the list goes on. This book lets readers know it is ok to be who God has called you to be and if you are not you are living a LIE." />
