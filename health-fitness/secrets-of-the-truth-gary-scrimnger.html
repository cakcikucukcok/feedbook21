  <title>Secrets of the Truth - Gary Scrimnger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It does not matter who or what you are:  As long as you are a normal thinking human being, it is clear. Unless we change something, our future is shrouded in calamity.
Whether it be self-destructionnuclear or otherwise, religious apocalypse, who knows, maybe chemical, bacterial/viral or some natural disaster bound to annihilate earthwe are here now, in this time, and we have the capacity to impact, change, and affect the future as no other earthly being (that we are aware of) is capable of doing.
The window of opportunity is staring us in the face, and we dont see it, grasp it, or realize it, for we are too preoccupied with the current system of survival and control.    
You do not have to acquire this book to discover its mission, for the clue lies within all of us as to what we are to do about this condition.
We all want and desire change, but each and every one of us feels disempowered, disenfranchised, and incapable of affecting the world around us.
That is so by design and intent. And the answer to this condition lies within us and is brought to the fore by the many spiritual and religious belief systems we so dearly cling to, but we do not practice it.
If you have now figured it out, then bring your force into action because that is exactly what this book isa means to expose, uncover, and mobilize the forces within and around us. And in so doing create a destiny closest aligned to what the Creator intended for all of us and our futures." />
