  <title>Vaccines - Kristen A. Feemster</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Immunization is regarded by many as one of the greatest advances in modern civilization. The widespread use of vaccines has led to increases in life expectancy, reductions in the occurrence of childhood diseases, and is generally credited with saving millions of lives annually.
But since their discovery two centuries ago, vaccines have been dogged by pockets of persistent distrust among those who are skeptical of their science or who find compulsory immunization at odds with personal liberty. The rise of these voices in contemporary culture has contributed to trends of vaccine delay and vaccine hesitancy in some communities -- a chasm between the general population and the scientific establishment that has persisted and grown at times across the last several decades.
&lt;em&gt;Vaccines: What Everyone Needs to Know? &lt;/em&gt;offers a scientifically grounded overview of the science, manufacture, and culture of vaccines in the United States and internationally. Aiming to offer an unbiased resource on this hotly debated subject, it provides accessible, authoritative overviews of the following:
? How vaccines work
? The history of vaccines
? Vaccine policy -- who writes it, and does it matter?
? The contents and manufacture of vaccines
? Vaccine injury
? The alleged link between vaccines and autism
? Vaccines and new outbreaks
Written by a leading authority in both infectious disease and vaccine education, this book offers a clear-eyed resource for parents or anyone with an interest in the use, efficacy, and controversy surrounding vaccines. In a subject area defined by partisanship, it offers reliable resource for what everyone needs to know." />
