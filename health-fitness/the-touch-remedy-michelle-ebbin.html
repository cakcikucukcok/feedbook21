  <title>The Touch Remedy - Michelle Ebbin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;An empowering guide that unites the ancient healing power of touch therapy&amp;#8212;from acupressure to reflexology&amp;#8212;with modern science to help relieve the number one cause of disease today: stress&amp;#8212;and to soothe anxiety, boost immunity, and alleviate pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human beings are wired for touch. Touch is critical to our physical and mental health. And for centuries, cultures around the globe have employed touch as a powerful force for healing. And yet America is an increasingly touch-deprived, high-stress culture, and we are paying for it with our wellbeing. Now, in &lt;em&gt;The Touch Remedy&lt;/em&gt;, leading touch therapy expert Michelle Ebbin, who appears regularly on &lt;em&gt;The Dr. Oz Show&lt;/em&gt; and has been featured on &lt;em&gt;The Doctors, The View,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Live with Kelly &amp;#38; Michael&lt;/em&gt;, demonstrates how the ancient wisdom of touch can truly change your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A fresh, contemporary approach to natural health, which draws on a unique combination of ancient wisdom and cutting edge research, &lt;em&gt;The Touch Remedy&lt;/em&gt; is a collection of proven touch therapy solutions to calm and heal every member of the family, from babies to grandparents to pets. Demystifying time-tested touch therapy techniques such as Acupressure, Reflexology, Cranial Sacral Therapy, among others, Ebbin shares her invaluable insight and provides clear, step-by-step remedies, accompanied by beautiful full-color photos, to relieve a range of physical and emotional stressors, from back pain and headache to anxiety. Her solutions are quick, taking only two-to-three minutes each, and easy, requiring only three steps, and most of the remedies can be done anytime, anywhere, even on the go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, Ebbin shows how touch therapy offers powerful strategies to improve intimacy in relationships, bond with your children, and improve communication through touch. With &lt;em&gt;The Touch Remedy&lt;/em&gt;, we can quite literally take our health into our own hands&amp;#8212;and nurture the bodies, minds, and spirit of our loved ones and ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;" />
