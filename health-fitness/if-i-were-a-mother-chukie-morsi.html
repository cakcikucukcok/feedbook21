  <title>If I Were a Mother - Chukie Morsi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book, If I Were a Mother, is a book of inspiration, revelation, and empowerment to ignite godly women to become achievers and to live triumphantly as mothers.
The inspiration to write this book came from my personal encounters in living with my mother and from the many mothers that I have been privileged to meet over time.
What I learned from my mother and these gracious mothers in the course of my growth in various stages in life has made me what I am. The motherly experiences that have sharpened my life as a man by my godly, industrious, lovely, resourceful, sweet, diligent, virtuous, prudent, faithful, charming, and understandable mother could be summed up in this book: to inspire, reveal, and empower every mother to become what they want to be in their fulfilling of Gods plans, purposes, and pursuits in their child and children, which are either given birth to or adopted or as a guardian." />
