  <title>Undefeated Michael Brunner - Mildred Trautman Bunn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My Grandfather, Mike Brunner, and his parents left the Old World to find freedom in America.
They were peasants living in a small village in Germany. The land was scarce and it had been tilled to its fullest. There were no prospects of acquiring more useable land. So they sought to better themselves in America. The struggle and determination of this frugal family, where there was no assistance or financial aid, is told in this biography. They were unable to speak or communicate in English, therefore, it made their trials and tribulations more complicated.
The treacherous trip in a medium size sailboat took months. They finally landed at New Orleans Harbor. Their harrowing experiences were magnified when they lost a brother in the strange land. However, determined to start a new life, the remaining family continued on to their appointed destination. They were committed to hard work and determination to succeed.
The Civil war had just begun so Mike enlisted with the Infantry at Ripley, Ohio. His experiences were horrifying. He was captured at Stone River and sent to Libby Prison. The torture and daring escape, his loss of freedom and the terrifying recapture and being sent to Andersonville Prison, are all told in this biography. Mike, all but lost his life from Cholera. After which he endured the tragic trip on the sinking Sultana.
More tragedy struck when his daughter was burned to death in a house fire. Trying to assist her he was badly burned himself and nearly lost his life once again.
Mike lived in a world that could not subdue him. However, he was left with the feeling of being lost in a country he fought so hard to succeed in." />
