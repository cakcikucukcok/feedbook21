  <title>Confronting Youth Apathy - Gregg Moore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The author in this book while recognizing the importance of other age groups in society, argues about the most crucial role of the youths in the healing wholeness and restoration of our world. And in so doing mentions one youth after another while yet recognizing in the work that youths too miss it and could be apathetic. And this being American presidential election year he even touched upon the the lives of characters like Hillary Clinton Dr. Ben Carson and Donald Trump since youths are described as the leaders of tomorrow, and today being the tomorrows of the above named politicians yesterday!
&lt;p&gt;
In a previous work: &lt;b&gt; &lt;i&gt; &lt;u&gt;White Black and Other &lt;/b&gt; &lt;/i&gt; &lt;/u&gt;, Moore focused on the unique problem of race in our world and attempted to formulate the Race Improvement Law for society for the reduction of racism in our world if not its complete eradication. And within 8 months from now he intends to publish another work, this time on a person: &lt;b&gt; &lt;i&gt; &lt;u&gt; FRANKLIN MOORE &lt;/b&gt; &lt;/i&gt; &lt;/u&gt;, who attended the most precious College in the West African region located at the outskirt of the most populous city of West Africa for a long time time  the G C I and was noted for several things chief of which was the game of soccer.
&lt;p&gt;
And after this work Moore intents to publish a book in the new year 2017 on a profession: the Wilily profession POLITICS. As usual he welcomes reactions to his work: past present and future." />
