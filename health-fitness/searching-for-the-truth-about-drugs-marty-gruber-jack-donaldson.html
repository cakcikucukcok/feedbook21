  <title>Searching for the Truth About Drugs - Marty Gruber, Jack Donaldson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;If you have ever wondered what it would be like to travel the road that a drug addict has chosen, sit back and read about the road into living helland back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marty Gruber abused drugs for 45 years, and he attempted suicide immediately before he found the door of escape from drug abuse, and the key to a meaningful life. With the aid of Providence Marty found long term meaning, and in the process he has been given the privilege of warning teens about the trap of drug abuse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research performed in 2010 shows that 48.2 percent of Americas high school seniors have tried illicit drugs. In 2011 the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) reported that drug abuse cost the United States six hundred and nine billion dollars ($609,000,000,000 is not a typo). Most drug addicts die from their addiction because becoming drug free requires help, and many never find that help. Research shows that for each dollar invested in drug abuse prevention, a savings of up to ten dollars in rehabilitation treatment can be achieved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A teenager cant see as far down the road as a seventy-five-year-old man who has already been down that road to just short of its logical enddeath. In Martys case, this was attempted suicide. Marty has returned to warn others not to take the road leading to drug abuse.&lt;br /&gt;
