  <title>Relationships for Life - Johnny Earl Jones, Richard Marks Ph.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;We all have these.  Sometimes, they can be the most wonderful treasure this world has to offer.  At other times, they can break your heart.  Im talking about relationships.  Everybody has a myriad of different relationships in this adventure called life.  Each relationship has its own dynamics, its own foibles, and its own language.  We interact with parents, children, siblings, co-workers, spouses, authority, and, for some, even God.  The greatest resource of joy, progress, hope, and prosperity is in connections with each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the problem is that the way we develop, sustain, and communicate in relationships is unhealthy.  The reason they are unhealthy is because we as individuals bring error into them from the past and from harmful views of ourselves.  If you cant think healthy about yourself, how can you interrelate with others in beneficial relationships?  How can you have a strong family and an intimate love life if you dont know how to communicate or meet each others needs?  What would be the purpose of building friendships if you dont know how to nurture and sustain them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is designed to answer all those questions and more.  Each chapter builds on how to improve yourself, your self-image, and the relationships around you.  You will discover from documented research how your brain works in diverse situations, the different ways you handle conflict, how to communicate effectively with others, and how to build the theme of Us-ness in lifes important relationships and much more.&lt;/p&gt;" />
