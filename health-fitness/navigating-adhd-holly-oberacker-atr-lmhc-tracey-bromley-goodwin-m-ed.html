  <title>Navigating Adhd - Holly Oberacker Atr Lmhc, Tracey Bromley Goodwin M.Ed.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;When parents first hear that their child has ADHD, many feel as if they&#39;ve been set adrift on an emotional sea of guilt, isolation, confusion, and fear. To help these parents and their children navigate the challenges of home life, school, and ADHD treatment, Tracey Bromley Goodwin and Holly Oberacker have created Navigating ADHD: Your Guide to the Flip Side of ADHD. This solutions-based guide to living with ADHD is a beacon for parents and children alike. Holly, an art therapist, and Tracey, an educational consultant and learning coach, have over 20 years of combined experience working with children and families living with ADHD. They use this experience to provide a depth of examples and hands-on solutions to the challenges of ADHD. The authors steer readers through an understanding of the ADHD diagnosis, communication strategies, social and organizational skills, and ADHD treatments, among other subjects. Each chapter presents real-life scenarios, concrete strategies, and proven solutions that give parents the confidence they need to help their child excel. Appendices in the back of the book provide additional resources for easy reference. Parents will come back to this book again and again for guidance, support, and peace of mind as they watch their child move from shame and isolation to understanding and excellence.&lt;/P&gt;" />
