  <title>It&#39;s Time to Play Outside - Miska L. Rynsburger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Richard Louv, author of Last Child in the Woods, lamented that children suffer from a nature-deficit.  Children need to play creatively outdoors exploring, discovering, experimenting, learning to enjoy themselves in nature.  I know we are supposed to turn off the cartoons but it can be hard some days.  Additionally, corporate America has sent a call to parents.  Young professionals are showing scars left from a childhood raised by helicopter parents.  Loving parents are pushing their way into grown childrens salary negotiations.  Johnny shows up late at the office because Moms phone was out therefore he didnt get his wake up call.  This book offers 101 fresh ways for a care-taker of young children to take five minutes of set up time initiating creative, independent play outdoors using everyday objects found in the house or yard.  These activities should not replace time spent with parents.  The value of love and attention from a parent is undisputable.  Rather, these creative play ideas are meant to become one part of your childs day when she can explore and experience nature independently.  No need to purchase more toys, batteries or DVDs.  Its all within your child and the yard.  Its time to play outside!" />
