  <title>Choose and Keep Your Partner Forever - Dr. Nezar Yassin Albar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Love is a commitment of respect  loyalty, tolerance, patience ,sacrifice ,support, causing no psychological, financial, moral or physical harm   and is that beautiful feelings that is to stay for life.
This book is the gift I wanted to give to love. This book is about you when you feel that you are ready to start a relation with a commitment for life. It is not about short duration fun and run stuff. Being ready to start this stage of your life makes you ready to start reading in this book. If you still in a totally different stage it is nice to read in such a book to know what is it about getting into a lifelong relation .
It is right that the perfect one is not easy to find and the 100% match may be  doesn&#39;t exist. For that with all the ideality you are going to see in this book you have to make your own way and your own equation to choose your future life partner. There is clear stress on specific secrets and that&#39;s why this book will at the end give you a new vision that helps to change the way you use to make your decision to a more wise and rational way but this book won&#39;t make the decision for you. At the end it is your call to make. I have tried to use the universal rules that can help anyone from any background or any culture to go through this big decision with more ideas and tools to use but still personal variations do exist and for that you should use your judgment as you read till you reach to your own equation.
  I had to wait for long long time till life creates inside me all the meanings and values I had in this book. I give this book for every one who wants to get into a relation that last forever. This book is not about how to catch interest of a smart woman. It is not about how to get attraction of a smart guy. It is about what comes after that. Now you both already attracted to each other but are you suitable for each other for a life long relationship and when you are suitable how can you both keep this relation for ever. This is what this book is about.
Its up to the reader to continue reading every next line and its up to the reader to follow what is written .I put here all the things that will help giving health and life for everyone&#39;s relations .With that it is very important that the reader use  mind ,experience and judgment to do or not do what is written. I am sure that everyone reads this book will find it the most useful book in relations ever. I put this book not to let you down. I put it for relations to start correctly and last forever." />
