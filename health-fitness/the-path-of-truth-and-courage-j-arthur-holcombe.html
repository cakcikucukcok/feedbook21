  <title>The Path of Truth and Courage - J. Arthur Holcombe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Path of Truth &amp; Courage takes readers through the journey of a young Sir John Holcombe as he pursues his life long dream of becoming a Knight. Through his travels he is introduced to new family members and friends, which teach him important lessons on character and friendship. Along the path to glory, Holcombe also encounters enemies and decisions that seem equally difficult to battle; but with perseverance, consideration and will-- they are challenged and won with all the glory and vigor of sword fighting, hand battle and bloodshed expected from centuries ago. 
Written in the setting of medieval times, the author writes with ease and explains lessons to the reader along the way that transcend time and can be applied to modern day living. The Path of Truth &amp; Courage has taken on a life of its own as a tale for children of all ages to read and enjoy through the eyes of a Knight in training. But the book does not stop there; adults can easily translate the lessons that are given in italicized portions of the book as a plan to overcome daily obstacles at work and in life. J. Arthur Holcombe is often humbled by the steps that readers have taken to utilize his methods. 
In the words of young and old, The Path of Truth &amp; Courage entertains the reader while carefully teaching that love for a goal and love for friends and family cannot be compromised. Clearly, this novel will continue to follow in the legendary steps of its main character Sir John Holcombe, Knight Crusader and Benevolent Lord of Dorchester. 
The first novel written by J. Arthur Holcombe has landed on nationwide bookstore shelves to overwhelming positive reviews from critics and readers from around the globe." />
