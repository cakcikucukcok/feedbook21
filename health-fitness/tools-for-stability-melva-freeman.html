  <title>Tools for Stability - Melva Freeman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Tools for Stability book is composed of tools that Melva has learned, not necessarily from doctors, but by her experiences. She wanted people to learn quickly what has taken her 25 years to learn. It comprises anger management, stress management, how to work with doctors, how to deal with medications, tips on saving money, how to find a compatible roommate, many other tools to survive in a troubled world, plus her experiences with having bipolar. It can not only help people with mental illness, but anyone that wants to improve their mental attitude and their relationships. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reading the book, Tools for Stability, was a fascinating journey from another persons vantage point as they experience life with a condition many people have. Tools for Stability is a valuable teaching book for psychologist in training themselves and their clients, for people with family and friends that could gain a compassionate viewpoint which would lead to understanding what someone is going through. Tools for Stability will assist people going through a similar circumstance to know they are not alone. Tools for Stability opened me up to realize how close we all are to possibly shifting into another world from the one we may be experiencing this day. Melva tells a vulnerable story in an elegant and straightforward way. We can learn about people around us, people we experience in the grocery stores, common areas, family and friends and gain more insight and show more kindness around this process to others. Reading Melvas book will no doubt be a useful professional psychology book. I believe strongly practitioners, hospitals and universities could benefit from Melvas work. The book Tools, is a positive book and perhaps life roadmap for people who are experiencing some similar situations. Melva herself shares a positive outcome in her own successful life letting others be aware they too, can recover. Melva was courageous to write and share this book and did it so well. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Respectfully, &lt;br /&gt;Marilyn P&lt;br /&gt;Medical Intuitive, Hypnotherapist, and Advocate of Independent Living for people with Disabilities&lt;/p&gt;

Dear Melva Freeman,
	I finished reading your book &quot;Tools for Stability&quot; about 2 months ago.  It has made a difference in my life in a positive way and pieces of it keep coming back to me when I need them. 
	When you first asked me to read it I was hesitant as I thought it was only for people who were diagnosed with manic depression. That would not apply to me. It is true I did get a greater understanding of what you, the author, deals with.  I appreciate that.  I also came to understand what we all had in common.
 	However what was more important to me was a better understanding of what I had to deal with.  I could use the commonsense and clear guidelines put forth in your &quot;Tools for Stability&quot;.  One that stands out to me is,   &quot;All medications have side effects.  Keep working with your doctor to find the best one for you.&quot;   That really helped me when I was going through a rough patch with my eyes.  
	I especially like the sections on anger, dealing with family and friends, general health guidelines and spirituality.  Although I had heard them before they were organized and written in a simple, straight forward manner. I plan to reread them.
	After I finished reading the &quot;Tools for Stability&quot; I recommended it to a friend.  She read it and has passed it on to other members in her family both male and female of different ages.    They have each found things that are helpful for them.  Now I have a real problem.  I don&#39;t have a book of my own.
	I am looking forward to the time when &quot;Tools for Stability&quot; is in print.  I think it will be a valuable  and helpful resource for a variety of people regardless of age, income or sex:  i.e. families, individuals, ordinary day to day living, people in jail, people with medical issues to name only a few. 
Thank you very much for lending me a reader&#39;s copy.
Nancy G.
Dear Melva,
	Just want to thank you so much for sharing your Tools for Stability with me.  I shared it with my son &amp; daughter-in-law and granddaughter  dont know how much they read  but they said they found it helpful and more understanding than some of the books they have read.
	My daughter has read it  We both feel that your thoughts and advice are very easy to understand.
	I have learned a lot by reading your book  Ive come to have great respect for anyone with mental illness  and to know the symptoms to look for  this both helps everyone- not just someone who has an illness  I have written some notes from your book  and I do hope you will be publishing it soon  As I would like to buy 2 copies  at least!
	To have been able to put your experience down for us to share has to have been difficult  but, Thank you for all of us who have so much to learn.  May God continue to bless you  and may you continue to be a Blessing to others.
