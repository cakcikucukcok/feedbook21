  <title>Chainbound - Walid el Houri</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Every so often, a book comes along, which challenges everything we think we know about love and relationships; a book that takes us on an incredible journey and allows us to glimpse those rare moments in life when love truly conquers all and sometimes the most unlikely candidates find themselves drawn to each other like bees to nectar. This is one such book.
In this book, you will discover that true love has no boundaries. It is the glue that holds the pages of life together for two unlikely souls who just happen to discover that love is timeless and does not come with an expiration date.  This book represents the intense love a man has for his wife. Its an uncommon union, to be sure, but make no mistake about it, for the love shared by these two unlikely people is real and true. You only need to read this love letter written by man to his wife to understand that true love cannot be quenched or stopped; it continues to grow into something intense and beautiful. 
What makes this book special is that it proves that fairytales can really come true when you let them. Heres one that did.
I was both entertained and fascinated. It is a powerful story and well told. A great read.
