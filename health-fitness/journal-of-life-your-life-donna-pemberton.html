  <title>Journal of Life . . . Your Life - Donna Pemberton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This journal is a practical avenue to clear your head so that you can focus and get on with your life. When the journal is full of your years achievements, highs and lows, you can sit back and say I survived, I forgot about that, I had a big year, and I made it happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of you will be goal-kicking experts; others will not even have a clue how to set one. This is a journal for you to write whatever you want, stick pictures, create timelines or maps, or just use as a daily journal of your normal days. Its totally up to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a thankful page after every journal page so you can write ten things youre grateful for without getting a separate book, and then theres a meditation space underneath so you can write about the experience, avoidance, timeout, and how hard or easy you found it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the journal are some ideas of things you can do to make life a pleasant experience on any budget. Its taking pleasure of the simple things in your own environment. Decluttering your space declutters your mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that positive reinforcement, the love of Mother Earth, and getting the monkey chatter out of your head and on to paper can help you achieve balance and peace. You are not alone on this earth, even if you feel alone. Through mediation on sending love to all the people going through the same experiences as you, we can be connected to one another without ever meeting and saying a word and by sending one another peace and love. I believe that if we fill the world with love and peace, even unspoken, we will win in settling the earth that we are creating.&lt;/p&gt;" />
