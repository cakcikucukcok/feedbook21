  <title>The Bolden Legacy - Essie M. Franklin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The reason for my writing this book is to not only to document my familys history, but to celebrate a long history of family togetherness, love and growth.  From humble roots we came and appreciate our heritage and look forward to the future.
From the union of two people, sprang an abundance of children, grandparents, grandchildren, nieces, nephews, aunts, and  uncles.  The family has a strong Christian base that has passed from generation to generation.  The Musical talent of many of the family members is also very obvious.  From the church to professional gospel and jazz artists, we love our music.
The Bolden/Grayson family has spread all over the U.S., but we still maintain strong family bonds and enjoy when we can come together and celebrates as a family.  Although there have been numerous occasions for us to come together for the loss of loved ones, we end up celebrating life also, and our time together as a family.  We communicate about family business, just to pass time or unfortunately, to pass along bad news.  Communications is very important to us as a family." />
