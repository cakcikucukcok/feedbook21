  <title>God, Why Didn&#39;t He Cover Me? - Karen D. Reid</title>

Emotionally and sexually abused by religious leaders, God has anointed me in the area of my affliction to purely expose the devices of Satan and challenge the Body of Christ to raise the standard of holiness, purity, and integrity. As I am willing to become transparent in this three-part series (From Mistress to Ministry), my testimony capitalizes on scriptural references and information, in conjunction with past experiences, to present a biblical reformation that will promote genuine holiness in a wayward church. The principle of spiritual warfare is that we must be called to order, before we can advance to the next level of victory. My objective is three-fold: to nurture damaged spirits, to foster a healing process for victims of abuse, and to present the deliverance that repentance brings to those who are trapped in sexual sins.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

Teachers, can our children expect you to be mentors, and not molesters? Executives, can your subordinates rely on you to refrain from sexual-harassment violations? Political officials, can your citizens depend on you to protect us against economic hardship?
