  <title>Come Jog with Me - George Whitney Dvm</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Many questions come to mind concerning running and runners and public health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Why do runners live an estimated 2 to 2.5 years longer than non-runners?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Why are runners rarely overweight?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Among runners do they have the same incidence of the following problems compared to non-runners that so far the causes of which are basically unknown? Muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis, Parkinsons disease, amelanotic lateral sclerosis and Alzheimers disease?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Why do women runners have so much less breast cancer than nonrunners?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. Why do runners have so much stronger bones than non-runners?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6. Why do runners have less atherosclerosis and therefore fewer strokes and coronary and cardiac artery disease?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7. Why do runners have more HDL (good ) cholesterol than non-runners?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8. Why do runners have lower blood pressure than non-runners?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9. Do running women have fewer children who develop Autism than non-running women?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10. Why do runners have better immune systems than non-runners?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11. Does running enhance the production of endomorphnis, serotonin, androgens, estrogens such as oxytocin, ghrlein, and the enzyme troponin and many others?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12. Is there an advantage of the profound sleep that comes to those who exercise as with running and with no insomnia?&lt;/p&gt;" />
