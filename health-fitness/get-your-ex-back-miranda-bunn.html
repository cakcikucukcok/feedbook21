      <meta name="description" content="Several stories, theories, and experiences help you get your ex back!&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Of course you can get your ex back. It happens all around you that people get back into the relationship and live happily ever after. But this time, you are going to learn from your mistakes; you are going to play it smart.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
In this book, I will refer a little to my own story as well as established methods and strategies (not what you think) that have worked for numerous people who wanted to rekindle the flame in their previous lover or partner. Everybody is special in their own way, but there are evident things you need to keep in mind if you want to have your ex fall in love with you all over again, even better than before.&lt;br /&gt;
You&amp;rsquo;ll learn, among others:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Ways to analyze what went wrong, why the breakup happened, and what to do&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Valuable tips of playing it right this time&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Sly and refined tactics to spark your ex&amp;rsquo;s interest again&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The facts about making it happen in the long run, with examples of dos and don&amp;rsquo;ts&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Thoughts about timing and the long talk you must have&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Tips on what to say and what not to say if you want to make an impression.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;And many good advice by someone who married her ex and leads a happy life&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;How men and women are different, and what pulls together or drives us apart&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The difference between hard to get and hard to want&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A healthy balance between contacting and keeping your distance&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Ways to regain your confidence and become even more attractive to your ex than before&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The hidden secrets so many men and women overlook when it comes to attracting the other sex&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Tips on phone calls, dates, pretending to be busy, and conversation techniques&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
