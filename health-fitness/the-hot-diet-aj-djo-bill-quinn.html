  <title>The Hot Diet - AJ Djo, Bill Quinn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Day by day, a silent poison is killing Americans. It is estimated that 64 percent of Americans are overweight or obese, resulting in the premature deaths of 500,000 people a year. That&#39;s more US deaths-every year-than were suffered during all of WWII. This poison is right under your nose, front and center at virtually every meal. Yet despite hundreds of diet books, thousands of seminars, and countless hours of research, it has escaped discovery. That&#39;s because, says chemical engineer AJ Djo, experts have been looking in all the wrong places.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Five years of intensive research into the eating habits of more than 100,000 subjects has unveiled the missing link between dieting and obesity. For the 100 million-plus Americans who try diet after diet-with rare success-this scientific breakthrough represents a solution that is not only logical and achievable but also sustainable for a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For the first time, here is a diet that incorporates all of the recommendations of leading nutritionists, dieticians, and governmental agencies . . . without the poisons. It took a man with AJ&#39;s unique multicultural background, scientific training, and spiritual depth to continue the long discovery process and put all the pieces together.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hot Diet&lt;/em&gt; offers a solution to the weight-gain problems of millions of people who have tried the so-called popular diets, who live in a world of &quot;Fat Clothes&quot; and &quot;Skinny Clothes,&quot; and who find that decade after decade, they continue to add a few pounds of unwanted weight every year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hot Diet&lt;/em&gt; is for the person who recognizes that there is more to life than food!&lt;/p&gt;" />
