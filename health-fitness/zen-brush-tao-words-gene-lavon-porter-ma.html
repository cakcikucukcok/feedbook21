	Leonardo Da Vince struggled with knowledge through vision at an early age. He perfected his method through his experiments, his art, and his notebooks.
	Miyamoto Musashi was Japans greatest swordsman. Through great struggle, he perfected a form of strategy and won every match. Later, he wrote &lt;i&gt;The Book of Five Rings,&lt;/i&gt; which became the bible of Japanese business strategy.
	As a boy, Thomas Alva Edison struggled with the Amateur Scientist experiments in &lt;i&gt;Scientific American&lt;/i&gt; magazine. Later, his inventions flowed from him like electricity flows along a wire.
