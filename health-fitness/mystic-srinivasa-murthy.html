      <meta name="description" content="We felt sorrow because of impermanence. The impermanence of relationship caused misery and pain. If we lost anything, we have to search where we lost it. If we lost peace in relationship due to impermanence, we can get it through relationship only. The hero in this story lost peace consequent deaths of his father and grandmother. He rejected the love of his classmate Neeraja. He left his mother and went to sages for the solution to his misery. During his visit, he met sage Jagadananda. He said that this world is illusion and preached non-dualistic theory of Sankaracharya. Afterwards, he went to sage Chidananda. He explained the paths of meditation. He also met Jain monks and Buddhist monks. He came to know about the philosophies of Jainism and Buddhism. He read about Aurobindos concepts and came to know about the mystic Ramakrishna Paramahamsa. He went to the Himalayas. He met his ancestral guru Saint Sachchidananda by chance at the Himalayas. On the advice of Saint Sachchidananda he returned to home and pardoned his mother with repentance. He accepted the love of Neeraja and started family life. He found the features of his father and grandmother in his offspring. His misery vanished." />
