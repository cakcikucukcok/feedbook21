  <title>The Fire Watchers - John Crawley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Im going to piss you off, hopefully, in a good way so you can use the energy creatively and help me fight the fire that has been growing ever so steadily in our nation. The title of this book, The Fire Watchers is a metaphor referencing the lack of continuum of care for our mentally ill and substance-addled folks, often one and the same person. Much of my focus is on the veterans returning from harms way in various parts of the world. They have a high rate of mental illnessPTSD (Post- [delayed, sometimes for months or years] traumatic stress disorder} and other maladies like major depression, bi-polar affective disorder, and TBI (traumatic brain injuries). There are many effective treatments for these issues that are not being used as frequently or as effectively as they should. Why not? I will document and discuss major reasons why much of our treatment services delivery system is flawed and, in many places, broken. We need a major effort in this country to repair whats broken. I will take us through, step by step, ways in which we can all work together to provide an efficient, less costly, and model system that rivals any in the world." />
