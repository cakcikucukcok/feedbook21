  <title>Biologic Revelation - Wayne Caparas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expert Reviews: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Superbly researched, very convincing. . . BioLogic Revelation is a New Dawn in the way we need to work out. Forget your daily, hour long, sweaty, modestly effective exercise routine. You need quality, over quantity. There is a better, quicker, more effective way for better results based on solid scientific research. Personally, I modified my routine based on these well-researched facts and I am loving the results. A MUST READ!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Adrienne Denese, M.D.&lt;br /&gt;
New York Times Bestselling Author&lt;br /&gt;
Harvard Researcher, Anti-Aging Expert&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you want to burn fat, build lean muscle, look younger and maintain youthful joints then I highly recommend Waynes new book BioLogic Revelation. In this book Wayne unlocks the secrets to not only getting in the best shape of your life but also how to use fitness to help you slow the aging process. If youre ready to transform your health and fitness level with less effort then I highly recommend reading this book and implementing the cutting edge and science-backed workout routine Wayne has created.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Josh Axe, Bestselling Author&lt;br /&gt;

Founder, DrAxe.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;BioLogic Revelation is going to revolutionize the fitness industry with its heavily researched, time-proven body of work. . . As a proponent of non-punishing fitness, I am relieved Wayne Caparas has written BioLogic Revelation. Now I have the resource to prove that more is not better, harder is not the answer, and proper form is always key to the results one needs and wants. Thanks to this groundbreaking book, undeniable proof is finally in black and white for all to see.
