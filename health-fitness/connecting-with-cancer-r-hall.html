  <title>Connecting with Cancer - R Hall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Surgeon: ‘You’ve got cancer, but we can keep you going for a few months, or maybe a few years.’
Me: ‘Okay, which is it: months or years?’
Surgeon: Silence.
 Me: ‘Will it kill me?’
Surgeon: ‘Yes, it probably will.’  That was when my head went into overdrive and I lost the plot.
 Hearing that you have cancer is a life-changing moment. Connecting with Cancer tells the stories of different people affected by different cancers: how their lives were changed, how they found an inner strength, how they found hope – and a life after cancer. Each story is personal and sometimes very intimate; in the pages of this
 book, you will learn what cancer feels like." />
