      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div id=&quot;00N40000001lfG7_ileinner&quot;&gt;Savage shares with you the triumphs and trials of new parenthood from initial sleep deprivation (It wasnt even living in actual days really more like an incoherent string of two-hour chunks) to losing the weight (My stomach not only bears a frightening resemblance to a deflated tire, but also has the texture of an orange peel). Savage takes you through a journey of Airplane Baby Haters, Mommys Night Out, Developmental Races, making friends with the Tim Hortons guy, and the joys of shared parenting. Youll feel like your having a drink with a good friend dishing about modern motherhood. Karen shows you how to sift through all the experts out there, cope with your in-laws and dealing your own insecurities, Savage reminds new moms that just doing your best is what already makes you a great mom, and that sometimes all you have to do is just show up for them, no experts required! Karen shares the journey with you, with humour, honesty, and empathy. From the magical to the maddening, Karen Savage guides you through the ups and downs of new parenthood, where instructions are not included.&lt;/div&gt;" />
