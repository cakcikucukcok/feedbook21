      <meta name="description" content="Living My Happily Ever After Daily is my personal account on how with Christ Jesus, you can live happily ever after daily. Within the book, I cover all the areas I personally utilize that assist me in living better daily. The storms are going to come, and life will not always be a bed of roses. Even so, you can still live happily in the midst of it all. You are not your current bad situation or horrible circumstance. You have the power to live a happy life in every situation . As a believer, you have the Holy Spirit dwelling within you. He is dwelling deep inside, awaiting an opportunity to give you everything you will ever need. When you become a believer, you gain a comforter, a counselor, a way maker, and a companion whose sole purpose is to show you how much you are loved by the Almighty Father. I pray you get to know this precious gift personally for yourself. Impossible is nothing with Christ Jesus." />
