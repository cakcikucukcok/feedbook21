  <title>Your Genes, Your Health: A Critical Family Guide That Could Save Your Life - Aubrey Milunsky, MD, DSc</title>
      <meta name="description" content="New advances in genetics have dramatically expanded our ability to avoid, prevent, diagnose, and treat a wide range of disorders.  Now, more than ever, families need to know about these new discoveries, especially as there are some 7,000 rare genetic diseases that afflict about 1 in 12 of us. In Your Genes, Your Health, Aubrey Milunsky provides an invaluable and authoritative guide to what you should know about your genes.  Illustrated with poignant family histories that underscore the lifesaving importance of knowing ones family medical history and ethnic origin, the book highlights the importance of recognizing seemingly unrelated disorders in a family as due to the same gene mutation and it outlines the key genetic tests needed for diagnosis, detection of carriers, and prenatal diagnosis.  Many genetic disorders are discussed including cancer, heart disease, autism, mental illness, birth defects, neurologic disorders, diabetes, obesity and much more.  The message of this book is clear--know your family history, be cognizant of your ethnic origins, seek appropriate consultations, and opt for meaningful genetic tests.  Recognition of your risk(s) enables prompt preemptive action.  By knowing your genes, you may save your life and the lives of those you love." />
