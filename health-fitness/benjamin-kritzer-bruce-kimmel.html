  <title>Benjamin Kritzer - Bruce Kimmel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P align=justify&gt;&lt;A href=&quot;http://www.authorhouse.com/BookTrailer/BenjaminKritzer.aspx&quot;&gt;Watch the book trailer for &lt;EM&gt;Benjamin Kritzer&lt;/EM&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=justify&gt;Meet nine-year-old Benjamin Kritzer. Growing up in 1950s Los Angeles, Benjamin believes that his parents are Martians, his brother is psychotic, and that hes being followed by Bad Men. He loves movies, movie theaters (especially ones with staircases for him to roll down), eating Shrimp Cocktail shrimps out of the big barrel in the kitchen of his fathers restaurant, and loves buying chocolate donuts from the Helms man. His strange grandparents live across from Ocean Park Pier, and his grandfather constantly says, &quot;What is it, fish?&quot; in response to whatever plate of food is put in front of him. Benjamins father sits at home in a pajama top and nothing else, while Benjamins mother is given to punishing Benjamin with a wooden hanger. However, Benjamin doesnt let anything get him down, and greets each day with wonder and a uniquely Benjamin sense of humor.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=justify&gt;But when he meets nine-year-old Susan Pomeroy, his entire world changes, as he and Susan embark on a relationship that is totally magical. Hilarious and touching, &lt;I&gt;Benjamin Kritzer&lt;/I&gt; is a valentine to growing up in a more innocent time, a valentine to a childs ability to persevere, and a very unexpected love story.&lt;/P&gt;" />
