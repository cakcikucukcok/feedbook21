  <title>The Big Deception - Connie Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book provides a reality check of what happens when men and women embark upon meaningful and loving relationships while remaining hideously scarred from bad ones!
Many people think that when they get into a new relationship that the hurt and pain from previous ones will be a distant memory and many wonderful and exciting days of bliss will lie ahead. Marcus thought this very thing but soon came to a horrible reality. This novel tells of one man&#39;s quest for true love and an unraveling turn of events it will take for him to find it. However, before finding her, he would first undergo utter deception and betrayal by a beautiful and cunning love interest which will cause his life to spiral completely out of control into a seemingly endless cycle of self destruction and vengeance against all women until fate steps in and ushers him toward the true love that awaits him.
Take a seat! Get a nice cold glass of lemonade and watch as the twists and turns of Marcuss life gleam as a mirror replica of your own life or someone you may know. Experience the thrill and suspense in each chapter as it stirs up an inner drive to make you want to get up and take charge of the direction of your life and relationships!" />
