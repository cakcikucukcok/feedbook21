  <title>The Many Parts of You - Jan Sky</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Clarity; Jans book and her unique skills can be summed in that single word; Clarity. Jans ability to help her clients, her friends and now with this book her readers, comes from her innate understanding of how to help us identify and remove blocks, both emotional and intellectual, to clear thinking, giving us the momentum to move&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;forward, toward our goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jack Fraenkel&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Chief Motivational Officer, Motivatories&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jan took me on a journey into myself and showed me how I make decisions. Since returning from that journey my understanding of myself has made even harder choices much easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gary Roberts&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Chief Engineer, Leading Sydney Hotel&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The implications in ones professional and personal life are huge. Reactionary? Proactionary? Knowing what ego states one has means freedom of choice of behaviour and emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lyn MacIntosh&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Counsellor, Clinical Hypnotherapist, NLP Master Practitioner.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the Many Parts of You Jan Sky has opened the door to a simple and effective way to dealing with our own blocks to achieving what we want from life. Jans style and ease of writing give us an accessible tool that we can use whenever and wherever we choose. This book is a gift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Liz Cassidy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Managing Director, Third Sigma International&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jan uses ESI process with in-mates in prison with outstanding results. The in-mates feel empowered by their realization that there are more parts to their personalities than their criminal parts. They appear to grasp this concept and appear to use this in addressing their offending behaviour after attending her program&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brenda Ambler&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Drug &amp; Alcohol / Holistic Counsellor, Dept of Corrective Services&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
