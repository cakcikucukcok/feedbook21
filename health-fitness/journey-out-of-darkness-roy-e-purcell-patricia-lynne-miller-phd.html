  <title>Journey out of Darkness - Roy E. Purcell, Patricia Lynne Miller Phd</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Roy Purcell swims through the tumultuous ocean of his unconscious, moving back and forth between it and his conscious mind. Concepts emerge from unexplained depths as images, which have become the basis for many of his paintings in his intriguing body of work. Raised in a loving Mormon family in rural Utah, Mr. Purcell, nevertheless, suffered because of his Aspergers dysfunctional personality. Unable to make social connections, Mr. Purcell retreats to nature and develops the sensitivity that will later open his unconscious. Journey out of Darkness is Mr. Purcells story of how he transcended his patriarchal heritage and Aspergers damaging personality to find peace as an accomplished artist. Critical to his growth and peace is his third wife and soul mate, Beverly, and the desert where they live in Green Valley, Arizona. Furthermore, the autobiography is the universal archetypal quest with Mr. Purcell as the hero who overcomes obstacles and slays the dragons of his troubled personality." />
