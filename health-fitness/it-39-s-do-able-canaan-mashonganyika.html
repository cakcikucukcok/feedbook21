      <meta name="description" content="Limiting beliefs tell you that now isnt the right time. Conditions will be more favourable in the future. When you are richer, or older and more mature, then you will be ready for change. The only thing holding you back is your beliefs. When you believe that you are stuck where you are, change becomes impossible. Now is the best time to start working on your dreams. Each day is a new opportunity to be all that you can be and do all that you can do. What you do today is crucial, because you are trading a day of your life for it. Remember, time is the most precious non-renewable resource that you have. When time has passed, its gone forever. When you waste time, you have wasted part of your life. Your seconds, minutes and hours are the measurement of your existence. The scales of life are always in balance. You always get back exactly what you give. If you work for only one hour on your goals, life gives you back only one hour of your dreams. Moving towards your destiny is a choice. There is no reason to wait. Your life must count for something good. This book provides the tools for discovering your talent and field of calling. You will be challenged to re-define your purpose in life!" />
