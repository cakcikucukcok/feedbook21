  <title>Excuse Me, Your Life Is Waiting! - Robert Boich</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; &lt;B&gt;Reader Views Annual Literary Awards 2010 &lt;/B&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The annual literary awards were established to honor writers who self-published or had their books published by a subsidy publisher, small press, University press, or independent book publisher geared for the North American reading audience.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;I&gt;Excuse Me, Your Life Is Waiting! &lt;/I&gt;, written by Robert W. Boich, and published by iUniverse has been named the 2010 Great Lakes Regional Winner; as well as the 2010 Reviewers Choice Award for the Best Regional Book of the Year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making a resolution to address an alcohol or substance abuse issue is only the beginning. The real work begins when the alcoholic or addict acknowledges that something has to be done. In &lt;i&gt;Excuse Me, Your Life is Waiting!&lt;/i&gt; author Robert Boich details his battle with substance abuse and his decision to lead a sober lifestyle. He realized if he didnt change his life, he would be incarcerated or die all alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this compelling, personal narrative, Boich shares his personal struggles and insights encountered during his first six months of recovery. A counselor once told him, An addict only has to change one thing: everything. &lt;i&gt;Excuse Me, Your Life is Waiting!&lt;/i&gt; describes the many changes Boich made in his life. More than just eliminating certain people and places from a daily routine, he illustrates how a successful recovery requires a brand-new approach in dealing with life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blending personal thoughts with helpful information, &lt;i&gt;Excuse Me, Your Life is Waiting!&lt;/i&gt; discusses the ideas and tools used in an addicts early recovery. It shows that sobriety is much more than mere abstinence and that alcohol and drug use is a sign of deep personal problems that only true sobriety can address.&lt;/p&gt;" />
