  <title>The Little Hormone That Can - Norma Jeanne Ceresia</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book was written specifically for frustrated dieters, people who have been trying and trying to lose weight but no diet works for them. They have suffered through embarrassment and humiliation and have given up.
This is a new day for people suffering from obesity. It really is your metabolism! We have inadvertently overlooked and left out a key hormone in our quest for weight loss. You will learn how to have your body produce and use this hormone so you can finally lose the weight. We will dispel the myths that are holding you back and give you the techniques to move you forward on your weight loss journey. It will become manageable and natural for you to lose weight. You have been taught that we are human and as such we are the same in many ways, but we are also each very different. There lies the clue for your success." />
