  <title>Power to the People - Dylan Freemen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Who are you? Where have you been to? Where are you going? Do you have a concept you can be something better? Are you concerned by the present social-economic situation? Would you like to attain complete spiritual freedom, a state in which at any future time nobody can manipulate you, control you, or enslave you?
Follow the path by the author, if you feel it necessary to attain power and control over your own life.  May you never be the same again! Unless of course you prefer to remain on the treadmill that has been trundling for more years than you can get into an Earth calculator.
In the ancient past societies believed men and women were gods: people who were highly developed spiritually.  You too can be amongst those gods.  You can because you have latent power completely unknown to you.  I intend to help you achieve that power in your own life.  It is time for you to have full control of your own destiny.  It is time for your spiritual freedom to again be brought to the fore and all the misery, pain, and degradation to be dissolved.
In this book, I will also be informing you of the true ruling classes of this planet, who have been conspiring against us, by implementing the imposition of a worldwide slave race.
I personally dont believe that any person, no matter their creed or religion, should be enslaved, murdered, tortured, raped, or indeed any of the other despicable activities that seem to be running rampant at this time, and indeed throughout the whole history of Planet Earth.
And so, I humbly offer up this possibly insignificant and meaningless work with a very simple comment: power to the people." />
