  <title>Beyond Betrayal: How God is Healing Women (and Couples) from Infidelity - Lisa Taylor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sexual addiction and infidelity have reached epidemic proportions. The result is devastation, not just to men&amp;rsquo;s souls, but also their wives&amp;rsquo; hearts. And while betrayed wives have an excruciating road ahead of them, many are learning that God is faithful to heal... and even redeem.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beyond Betrayal&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;interweaves the stories of betrayed wives &amp;ndash; including the author&amp;rsquo;s personal story &amp;ndash; with the latest research on sexual addiction and partner trauma. That research includes the largest survey to-date of wives of sex addicts &amp;ndash; a study conducted specifically for this book.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Wherever a woman is on her journey,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Beyond Betrayal&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;offers her clear, realistic guidance on how to move forward into the healing God has for her. The stories recounted are authentic and grace-filled &amp;mdash; because we&amp;rsquo;ve all messed up in our pain and we all struggle with issues such as anger, boundaries and forgiveness. Despite this, God&amp;rsquo;s arms are wide-open and He is actively working to bring us to new levels of faith, wholeness and maturity: as individuals, couples, families and communities.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;With a foreword by author, Marsha Means, A Circle of Joy ministries&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Lisa Taylor captures the pain a family goes through during betrayal trauma, AND, the hope that they can find in a journey of healing. This book is powerful and written by a lady who is committed to bring hope and healing to your heart.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash; Richard Blankenship, Author of &amp;ldquo;Spouses of Sex Addicts: Hope for the Journey&amp;rdquo;; President, International Association of Certified Sex Addiction Specialists&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Beyond Betrayal&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;is a needed and welcome addition for partners of sex addicts.

I felt reassured and comforted throughout reading it: a sense of safety that Daddy understands me and loves me where I am on my journey with a sex-addicted husband.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ndash; Amanda, CPSAS, Founder, Worthy of Love ministries, Queensland, Australia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
