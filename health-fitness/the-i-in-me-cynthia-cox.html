  <title>The I in Me - Cynthia Cox</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&quot;I&quot; is a word that you will read more frequent than most would expect to see. But in giving you &quot;I&quot;, I hope only for you to see your &quot;I&quot; in you too. I only want to show you what pain, hurt, shame, guilt, betrayal and broken love can really do for you. When you are strong enough to release the &quot;I&quot; in you, this book will be waiting for you.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Cynthia has struggled for three decades of her life piecing together the puzzles of a life raised in an Incest and Ritual Abuse family environment in the southern hills of West Virginia. Her silence that occurred in her years of abuse has given her the adult courage to speak the truth of what others said she should never tell society.&lt;/P&gt;
