  <title>The Formula - Ronald F. Ferguson, Tatsha Robertson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;We all want our children to reach their fullest potential—to be smart and well adjusted, and to make a difference in the world. We wonder why, for some people, success seems to come so naturally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could the secret be how they were parented? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book unveils how parenting helped shape some of the most fascinating people you will ever encounter, by doing things that almost any parent can do. You don&#39;t have to be wealthy or influential to ensure your child reaches their greatest potential. What you do need is commitment—and the strategies outlined in this book. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The Formula: Unlocking the Secrets to Raising Highly Successful Children&lt;/em&gt;, Harvard economist Ronald Ferguson, named in a &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; profile as the foremost expert on the US educational &quot;achievement gap,&quot; along with award-winning journalist Tatsha Robertson, reveal an intriguing blueprint for helping children from all types of backgrounds become successful adults. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Featuring hundreds of interviews with high-achievers and their parents, the book includes never-before-published findings from the &quot;How I was Parented Project&quot; at Harvard University, which draws on the varying life experiences of 120 Harvard students. Ferguson and Robertson have isolated a pattern with seven roles of the &quot;Master Parent&quot; that make up the Formula: the Early Learning Partner, the Flight Engineer, the Philosopher, the Fixer, the Model, the Negotiator-Counselor, and the GPS Navigational Voice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Formula&lt;/em&gt; combines the latest scientific research on child development, learning, and brain growth and illustrates with life stories of extraordinary individuals—from the Harvard-educated Ghanian entrepreneur who, as the young child of a rural doctor, was welcomed in his father&#39;s secretive late-night political meetings; to the nation&#39;s youngest state-wide elected official, whose hardworking father taught him math and science during grueling days on the family farm in Kentucky; to the DREAMer immigration lawyer whose low-wage mother pawned her wedding ring to buy her academically outstanding child a special flute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Formula&lt;/em&gt; reveals strategies on how you—regardless of race, class, or background—can help your children become the best they can be and shows ways to maximize their chances for happy and purposeful lives.&lt;/p&gt;" />
