  <title>Journey to Wholeness  Reflections for Transforming Your Life - Jean Farish, PhD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Journey To Wholeness  Reflections for Transforming Your Life is an inspirational book designed to inspire conscious living and serve as a catalyst for transformation.  It reflects on the human condition and our yearning for inner harmony and fulfillment as we struggle to return to our innate state of wholeness.  
Wholeness is a natural and innate state of being.  It is ultimate fulfillment. It is a conscious connection to our core being.  Life circumstances and experiences often fracture aspects of ourselves and shift us into a different state of reality as we struggle against who we really are. Thus, we find ourselves lost  in illusions and false beliefs and must find our way back to our center of wholeness.  The challenge is becoming more congruent and connected with the mental, physical, emotional, intellectual and spiritual aspect of ourselves; living well, and ultimately loving ourselves into wholeness...ultimate fulfillment.
 The book offers a unique and fundamental approach for insightful introspection on topics relevant to our daily existence with reflective thoughts for us to ponder in moments of happiness and those of quiet desperation.  Eastern and western  principles, practices and creative inspirations from great thinkers of our time on being whole and living well provides a variety of perspectives for personal growth and self-renewal on our  journey to wholeness.   As we become more knowledgeable of ourselves and aware in our daily lives, and sustain a mindset of conscious living with the realization that each moment presents a fresh opportunity to begin again.  The author shares personal perspectives that are meaningful and insightful in the struggle for wholeness.   Our labyrinth journey of life takes us out and back home to the place of wholeness wherein lies ultimate fulfillment." />
