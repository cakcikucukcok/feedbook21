The messengers were calling people to a heavenly state where there could be no presidents and no governments, thus no slavery. Those messengers spoke out all the codes of the Utopia. But what was the great truth they told, so that masses of slaves followed them? How were the religions turned to a part of slavery system, although they were against slavery?
