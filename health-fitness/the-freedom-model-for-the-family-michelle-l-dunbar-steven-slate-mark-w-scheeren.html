  <title>The Freedom Model for the Family - Michelle L Dunbar, Steven Slate, Mark W Scheeren</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Freedom Model for the Family is an approach for families dealing with a loved one who is struggling from addiction. It was written by the authors of The Freedom Model for Addictions and uses the same principles in a way that families can apply them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Addiction is not a disease, and it&amp;#39;s definitely not a &amp;quot;family disease&amp;quot;. Treating it like one has led us to the crisis we&amp;#39;re seeing today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treatment plays both sides of the fence. It labels addiction a disease, but then advises families to implement &amp;ldquo;tough love&amp;rdquo; and cut the substance user off. Can you imagine screaming at your son suffering from cancer that you&amp;#39;re done with him and will no longer support him due to his cancer? Can you imagine oncologists advocating that families cut off their loved one with cancer? No one would ever do that, yet it happens around the country every day regarding &amp;quot;addiction.&amp;quot; It is time for a solution that lets go of the disease mythology while not demanding you abandon your loved one or coerce them into disease-based treatment. There is a better way&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, we now know what addiction is and what it is not, we know why people struggle, and we know how best to help them and their families. There&amp;rsquo;s a viable solution that has helped thousands of people to put addiction and substance use problems behind them for good. Based on three decades of research and experience helping substance users and their families, &lt;em&gt;The Freedom Model for Addictions and The Freedom Model for the Family&lt;/em&gt; is nothing short of revolutionary.&lt;/p&gt;" />
