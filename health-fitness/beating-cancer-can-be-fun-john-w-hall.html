  <title>Beating Cancer Can Be Fun - John W. Hall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;How John Hall&#39;s book is different from others&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**John was diagnosed with Melanoma Cancer IV, had surgery to remove 10 metasticized tumors, but afterwards was informed by his Oncologist M.D. that there was little or no hope for recovery-- since Chemo and Radiation Therapy do not work on Melanoma, John felt like he was facing immediate death in the next few months.  However under the guidance of a Holistic Nutritionist he was able to rebuild his Immune System.  As a result, 2 years later, has conquered his cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**As an ex Premedical student, John had studied Inorganic and Organic Chemistry so that he has been able to do research on the causes, preventions, and possible cures for cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**John is currently a Family Therapist in Roseville, Ca, and for the past 30 years has counseled the emotional and psychological issues of his clients.  He now also counsels cancer patients related to their emotional and relationship problems.

&lt;p&gt;**His major goal is to help others build up their Immune System.  He believes, from experience, cancer can be cured with proper nutrition. The book cover is a microscopic image of a neutrofil
swallowing the anthrax bacteria, as the best proof of EVIDENCE-BASED NUTRITION IN SCIENCE
TODAY(an example of how the human immune system&#39;s defenses are what prevent diseases
and cancers). Further explained in Chapter 3 of the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**The material he presents is brief, in summary form, and is easy to read.  He makes suggestions of the best foods to eat, supplements, and healthy waters to consider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**John learned doctors are not gods, don&#39;t have the answers to what cures cancers, and patients need to become aware that a healthy nutritional approach for their condition is a viable and doable program.  He did it an won.  He hopes you will too.&lt;/p&gt;" />
