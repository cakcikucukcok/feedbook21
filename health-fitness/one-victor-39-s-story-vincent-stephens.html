      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Vincent Stephens Jr. is a young man with a promising future until he is struck by the mysteries of multiple sclerosis. In a few tragic years, he is transformed from a healthy college student into a helpless wheelchair victim who can do nothing for himself.
