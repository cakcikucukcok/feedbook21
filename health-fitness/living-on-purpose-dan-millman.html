  <title>Living on Purpose - Dan Millman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Each one of Dan Millman&#39;s best-selling books presents new keys to the &quot;peaceful warrior&#39;s way of living.&quot; Each offers a different aspect of Dan&#39;s philosophy - relevant, user-friendly, real-world guidance for everyday life. For the first time, in Living on Purpose, Dan answers some of the toughest questions we face. Organized into twenty-four key principles to answer some of life&#39;s toughest questions, Living on Purpose refines and expands on the teaching of his other books with fresh insight. Each of the principles, in turn, features further questions and answers more specific, related challenges.
Building a bridge between idealism and realism, Dan applies timeless principles to pressing questions from all over the world — questions on metaphysics, destiny versus free will, control and surrender, goal making, and setting life priorities, as well as common everyday challenges, such as child rearing, divorce, drugs, money and work, sexuality, and simplifying your life.
In Living on Purpose, Dan Millman combines the wisdom of Solomon with the commonsense touch of Dear Abby, taking on real-world questions with the insight and knowledge that have drawn millions of readers to his books." />
