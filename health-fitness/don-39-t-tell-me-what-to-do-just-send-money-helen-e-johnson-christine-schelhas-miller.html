  <title>Don&#39;t Tell Me What to Do, Just Send Money - Helen E. Johnson, Christine Schelhas-Miller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This completely revised and updated edition of &lt;i&gt;Don&#39;t Tell Me What To Do, Just Send Money &lt;/i&gt;prepares parents for the issues that they will encounter during their children&#39;s college years. Since our original publication over ten years ago, there has been a dramatic increase in the use of cell phone and internet technology. The birth of the term &#39;helicopter parent&#39; is, in part, due to the instant and frequent connectivity that parents have with their children today. Parents are struggling with the appropriate use of communicative technology and aren&#39;t aware of its impact on their child&#39;s development, both personally and academically. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With straightforward practicality and using humorous and helpful case examples and dialogues, &lt;i&gt;Don&#39;t Tell Me What To Do, Just Send Money &lt;/i&gt;helps parents lay the groundwork for a new kind of relationship so that they can help their child more effectively handle everything they&#39;ll encounter during their college years.&lt;/p&gt;" />
