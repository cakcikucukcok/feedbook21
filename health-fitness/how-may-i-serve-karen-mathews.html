      <meta name="description" content="How May I Serve is a guide to empower women who are struggling to find a way out of their troubles. I have tortured and abused myself for many years trying to find love, happiness, and peace of mindyet, the more I sought these things, the more they eluded me.
Then, I realized that it was an inside job. I had to learn to love myself, forgive myself, and make peace with myself. So many women have been brought up with limiting beliefs about themselves from childhood. From the time I was conceived, I was an unwanted pregnancy. 
From the deep recesses of my subconscious mind, I programmed a tape of being unloved and unlovable. I acted and attracted circumstance after circumstance to validate this belief. I played the victim role very well. I did not know how to get out of my own way. The more I avoided looking at the cause of the problems, however, the worse they got. 
I hit my bottom upon finding out that my oldest daughter had a heroin addiction. This brought everything full circle. In order to save her, I had to change myself." />
