      <meta name="description" content="The population of people with low vision is increasing. Services are needed to meet their needs for education and rehabilitation. Clinical measurements of vision do not correlate with how a person uses vision. Low-vision service in many developing countries is of recent origin. Many primary eye-care providers in developing countries may not understand the importance of low-vision rehabilitation service and do not carry out the functional vision assessment. Hence the functional vision assessment and developing visual efficiency depend on the educators and rehabilitation professionals. This book describes the vision assessment using simple techniques and functional vision assessment procedure. Visual efficiency, the ability to use vision effectively can be developed by instructional strategies and environmental adaptations.
This book describes the techniques with illustrations. The use of optical devices may require a structured practice. The readers will understand that efficiency in the use of optical devices may help the low-vision childs academic success. This guide addresses that decision about reading medium of low-vision students is based on the structure of impairment and the sensory capabilities. The book also includes the educational needs of low-vision students. This book can be taken as a well-organized guide and textbook for teachers, researchers, parents, and low-vision persons themselves." />
