  <title>The Shy Guy&#39;s Guide to Dating - Barry Dutter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The authoritative guide that will take shy guys everywhere-from the first date to home plate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Hey baby, what&#39;s your sign?&quot; &quot;Come here often?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These lines may work in the movies, but not in real life, and not for the millions of guys too shy to risk their dignity on such flimsy pickup lines. Barry Dutter knows, he used to be a shy guy himself, sitting at home night after night watching television because asking a woman for a date was simply too scary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not anymore. He&#39;s learned dozens of tricks to help shy guys ease into the swing of dating while avoiding humiliating rejections and romantic disasters. Keeping a shy guy&#39;s tender ego in mind, he tells guys where to meet women, which ones to approach and which to avoid. Readers will learn what to do with them, and how to act from the first date through commitment time. Filled with hilarious lessons from the pop culture we grew up in, this witty, commonsense guide is a must for everyone who&#39;s ever been afraid to try-which means everyone.&lt;/p&gt;" />
