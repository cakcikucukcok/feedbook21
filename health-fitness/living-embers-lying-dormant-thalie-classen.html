  <title>Living Embers Lying Dormant - Thalie Classen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This  book  I  believe,  would  make  a  difference  in  the  lives  of  many  people. It  differentiates  between  being  at  peace  and  saying  that  you  are. It  provides  ways  in  which, to  edify  yourself  when  life  is  at  its  worst for you. Sometimes  when  we  hear  of  motivational  stories  more  than  once, it  sounds  all too  common. But, I can  assure  you  that  reading  something  the  second  time  round can  help  you  see things  so  much  differently  than  just  a  few  days  ago maybe, because  today  you  might  read  to  understand. When  life-threatening  situations  suddenly  appear, we feel  as  if  we  have  lost  our  space  to  think or, even  move. It  cripples  us  or  so  it  feels, because trials  only  get  us  down  when we  allow  it  to. The  contents  of  this  book has  guidelines   that  will  help  you see  your  worth  and  will  cause  good  results  to  manifest  in  your  lifes  journey. Be  inspired  to  shine with  radiance  that  will  draw  people, so  that  you  can  sow  good  things  into  their  lives, because  when  you  are  upright  with  others  it  can  only  go  well  with  your  soul." />
