  <title>Svadhishtana - The Second Chakra - French Academy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The second chakra controls the Essential and Sensual body. This chakra regulates sexuality, reproduction, emotions, instincts, food and general communication of the body with the consciousness that inhabits it. The first chakra controls the male component of sexuality and the second chakra controls the female one. This chakra is more sensual than sexual. It tells us how we feel about sex and about having children, where the first chakra controls sex for fun, for power and for procreation. In addition to reproduction, the second chakra also controls other types of creativity. Swimming, nature walks and gardening use the connection of the second chakra with nature. Sculpture and carving use materials and objects of nature as a medium and often nature is the &amp;quot;subject&amp;quot; of painters and photographers. With dance and martial arts, the sacral area is seen as a base, the area that must be kept in alignment with the earth, so that a perfect balance can be maintained. Like the first chakra, the second chakra controls survival, but with female polarity. The first chakra controls the struggle for survival, while the second chakra controls the instincts for survival. The first chakra urges us to fight and protect, where the second chakra helps us to use our instincts to find a safe place to hide, to live and to raise our children. Like the first chakra, the second chakra also controls money, but again, in a different way. The first chakra controls the money and power it has, where the second chakra controls the money and security it gives. Svadhishtana is related to the element of water and contains the ability to feel emotions, is connected with the desire for sexual union with the other and reproduction, oversees the need to socialize and expose our personality, the balance between giving and having. The qualities that characterize it are sensitivity and creativity." />
