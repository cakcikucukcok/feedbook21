  <title>The Girl&#39;s Guide to Being Single - Kym Kostos</title>
      <meta name="description" content="You&#39;re a single girl who is independent and carefree. Maybe you&#39;ve just gotten out of a divorce or it&#39;s been awhile since your break-up with your boyfriend. You&#39;ve gotten over the relationship ending and you are comfortable and actually happy being single. Sure, there are times when you wish you had someone to cuddle with on those cold and rainy nights, but you have learned to compensate and be good to yourself, instead of worrying about how to please the other person.     Your happiness as a single girl depends on how you deal with it. There are many things you can do to celebrate your shackles being unlocked. One of them is NOT sitting at home moping around wishing you had someone to share your life with.   With that attitude, you exude desperation and loneliness and ask any guy, that is a major turn off, even other girls will tell you that a desperate guy isn&#39;t attractive at all. Men love confident women, not to be confused with cocky or arrogant." />
