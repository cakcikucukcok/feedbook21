Living is where sorrow meets joy, where pain encounters ecstasy, where the weakness of the flesh is buoyed by the strength of faith, where love conquers all doubts and betrayals. Marriage is for better and worse, for richer and poorer, in sickness and health; it is for life and death. Spirituality is the arduous integration of lifes dispositions and tendencies, of ones urges and habits, for the whole to reach out in transcendence to ones fellow human beings and to God. Growth to Christian maturity is actualizing the intersecting, because cruciform, demands of love of God and love of neighbor, which follows the path that leads from Good Friday to Easter Sunday.&lt;/P&gt;
