  <title>And the Greatest of These - Joe Michael Pritchard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; At first glance they seemed like all the rest. All the rest, that is, in a psychiatric emergency room. I make my meager living in one of Nashville&amp;#39;s busiest mental health thoroughfares. The white collars who sign my bi-monthly checks call me an assessment specialist, a fancy name for a crisis counselor. They give me a badge with my mug shot, tell me to admit all paying customers, and pray that I stay in touch with reality along the way. Sometimes I wonder which side of the assessment desk I belong on.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; On any given day, I have the&amp;nbsp;twelve-hour pleasure of discussing the game of life with the homeless and the hopeless both young and old, rich and poor, including physically&amp;nbsp;and sexually tramautized kids, women, men, and, sad to say, the newest members of the abuse club -- the elderly.From street-hustling hookers selling their souls for one more hit off that crack pipe to uptown alcoholics craving another shot to sustain their lives; from Alzherimer&amp;#39;s patients lost in some fog of a life to overdose victims way down on life to schizophrenics who see things in a different light, the psychiatric soul train never&amp;nbsp;ceases to chug its way along the bruised and battered halls of Faith General, Nashville&amp;#39;s oldest hospital.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I don&amp;#39;t mean to sound calloused. It&amp;#39;s just that day after depressing day I hear their stories when, in reality,&amp;nbsp;I only need about five minutes to determine whether or not they&amp;nbsp;warrant admission to one of our six psychiatric units.&amp;nbsp;Most, however, want to ramble on, and they do until I gingerly cut them off. Speed is critical in my job as an assessment specialist. If I spend too much time with one case, the ER backs up and everyone becomes testy, especially the docs and nurses who don&amp;#39;t like dealing with&amp;nbsp;psychiatric patients. I don&amp;#39;t blame them. I don&amp;#39;t like dealing with psychiatric patients who have medical problems.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I still have a heart for those who genuinely want and need help. I just know how to keep my emotions at bay and do my job with the precision and aloofness of a brain surgeon. I do care, but I don&amp;#39;t. It&amp;#39;s an art form: rapid-fire manipulation of multiple systems to quickly get them&amp;nbsp;treatment while making each one feel cared for. I tell&amp;nbsp; the rookie staff it&amp;#39;s the closest we&amp;#39;ll ever get to Hollywood.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; And so it was with John and Maggie Dalton. They weren&amp;#39;t the first elderly couple I had assessed and subsequently admitted (one or the other) to our geriatric psychiatric unit. I&amp;#39;m uncomfortable&amp;nbsp;dealing with that population. Too much medical and way too close to home and a myriad of memories about Mom and Pop. Escorting&amp;nbsp;couples down&amp;nbsp;that unpredictable geri-psych&amp;nbsp;hallway was a task I often found a way to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; It was past my clock-out time, when I should have been home sipping bourbon and self-stimulating the night away with my TV buttons, that I saw Maggie Dalton stroke John&amp;#39;s haggard face. That picture ripped right&amp;nbsp;through my Hollywood persona to the core of my soul. In that instant, I saw Mom stroking Pop&amp;#39;s deceased face and fighting back tears, that&amp;nbsp;little-girl-lost look in her hazel eyes a replica of Maggie&amp;#39;s eyes that night.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; It was a line I&amp;#39;d vowed never to cross again -- unconditional love of another human being.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
