  <title>“Watch out for Them Booby Traps” - Ayo&#39;</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As a mother, even with a degree in child and adolescent development, I have faced many things that humbled me. All the things I felt I knew about parenting were thrown out the window when I became a mother. Many times, I got lost in the day-to-day demands of motherhood and stopped celebrating my children and the joy they bring to my life.
Their struggles and lifes struggles knocked me down at times, but I learned to laugh instead of cry. Well, sometimes I cried then laughed, and other times I cried until I laughed. My purpose in writing this book was to help other parents find the humor in lifes ups and downs.
Even as I write this, I am threatening to cause bodily harm to my children if they interrupt me one more time. Dont panic; they will live. Me, I am not so sure. Colton is rearranging my living room, which drives this OCD mom crazy. He is hiding dirty socks in my pots and pans, but no worries, I will wash them before I cook with themwell, if I remember. Payton is turning his comforter into a cape and diving off the furniture, yelling that he is taking over the world. Lets not forget the five thousand philosophical questions he has asked today, starting at seven a.m.
In the middle of this chaos, it is so easy for me to forget the sweet moments. Several years ago, I decided to write down little blurbs that my boys said and funny situations that reminded me they are precious gifts. This is what inspired me to write this book and share it with you. I want to use this to celebrate my boys while encouraging you to do the same thing." />
