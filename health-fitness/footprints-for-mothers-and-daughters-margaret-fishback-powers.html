  <title>Footprints For Mothers And Daughters - Margaret Fishback Powers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For more than four decades, “Footprints” has touched millions of people around the world. Now, Margaret Fishback Powers, the author of that beloved poem, has compiled stories and sayings that celebrate the special bond between mothers and daughters. She includes the touching story of a young girl’s last visit with her grandmother; moving tales of motherly love, sacrifice and quiet strength; remembrances of a rural childhood; deeply honest pieces about challenges and concerns; and stories that will bring a smile to your face.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Throughout &lt;em&gt;Footprints for Mothers and Daughters&lt;/em&gt;, there are inspiring and humorous quotations from famous and not-so- famous moms -- and even treasured family recipes that have been handed down from mother to daughter. A number of the stories are by Margaret Fishback Powers herself, from her perspective as a mom and a daughter, a grandmother and a granddaughter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Footprints for Mothers and Daughters&lt;/em&gt; is an uplifting treasury and a perfect gift for women of all ages.&lt;/p&gt;" />
