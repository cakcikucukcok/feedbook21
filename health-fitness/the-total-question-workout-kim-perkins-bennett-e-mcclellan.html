  <title>The Total Question Workout - Kim Perkins, Bennett E. McClellan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Heres the one-minute description of TQW:
You have a Big Question of some kind.  You know its a Big Question because its keeping you up at night, the outcome is important, and you dont have a ready answer.
There are four stages you need to go through to answer a Big Question.  I dont know where you are in the process; so let me describe the four stages.
The first stage involves fully understanding your situation and your motives for wanting to resolve the question that comes from being in that situation.
The second stage involves separating yourself from the situation you are in.  You cannot resolve a situation if you see yourself as part of it.  You have to gain perspective by separating yourself from your situation in as many ways as possible.
The third stage involves letting go of something that keeps you attached to, and subject to, the situation you are in.  Something is holding you back.  Some fear, some projection of implications, some belief about what is possible and what is not possible.  Something.  As long as you hold onto these things they will hold you back.  
Fourth, you need to perceive new possibilities for resolving your Big Question.  For various reasons, you are not able to see alternative resolutions today.  You need to reframe your question in a way that will enable you to apply the substantial resources you have to address each and every part of the question.  
If you have a Big Question, you are stuck at one of those four stages. 
At which stage are you stuck?
McClellan provides a complete roadmap for getting from the question you have to the question you need to answer.  Dither no longer.  Commit to the Total Question Workout.  Address the Big Question you need to answer to take charge of running your business or your life.  You can move forward.  But first, you have to take the next step." />
