  <title>Fit, Healthy, Happy Mum: How My Quest for Perfect Breastmilk Helped Me Lose 24 Kilos in Only 8 Weeks After the Birth of My 4th Baby - Julius Kieser, Sharny Kieser</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The cover of this book suggests it is a diet book. Or a weight loss book. It is so much more than that.  It is a first hand account of a mother, who through societal pressure felt she had messed up her first 3 births (and kids).   Share Sharny&#39;s journey as she tells you how she went from being the slave in her life, feeling trapped as though she were in a coffin called &quot;bad parenting&quot;, with each new birth, she felt like she was driving a nail of failure on herself. Too tired to function, not enough milk, etc etc. All she wanted to be was the perfect mother to her children, but through lack of confidence, stopped listening to her intuition and became her worst enemy.   With baby number 4, she decided to do things differently, very differently. Through ignoring society, listening to her inner voice and really focussing on herself as a mother, she turned her life around. She changed her eating to be for wellness and best quality breastmilk, and as a result lost 24kg in 8 weeks.   But if that&#39;s all you get from the book, you only read the cover. Inside is a treasure trove of advice, and the courageous story of a public figure who through honesty to herself, turned her life around in a way that any woman can relate. And benefit." />
