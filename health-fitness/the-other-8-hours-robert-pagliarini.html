  <title>The Other 8 Hours - Robert Pagliarini</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;You sleep (hopefully) for 8 hours. You work (at least) 8 hours. What are you doing in those remaining 8 hours of your day, and more importantly, what are the other 8 hours doing for you? To the bleary-eyed worker who doesn&#39;t have time to stop and catch his breath, the idea of having 8 hours may sound absurd. If that&#39;s you, this is your wake-up call. THE OTHER 8 HOURS provides a blueprint that will help you carve out more time in your day and find the inspiration to spend that free time in a more productive way. Whether you want to pay off debt, make more money, start a business, develop a hobby, write a blog, or write the next great American novel, Robert Pagliarini will get you closer to living a richer, more fulfilled life.  In THE OTHER 8 HOURS, you&#39;ll learn how to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- GET MORE TIME: Chances are you are overworked, overscheduled, and overstressed. There&#39;s too much to do and not enough time. You can create &lt;i&gt;hours&lt;/i&gt; of additional free time you never knew you had.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- GET MORE MONEY: Traditional financial advice has likely left you frustrated and stuck. Pagliarini introduces new, highly-effective yet unconventional strategies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- GET A LIFE: In order to &quot;get rich&quot; you have to &quot;get a life.&quot; The other 8 hours ultimately determine your happiness and net worth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With anecdotes and inspiration from many who have taken control of their other 8 hours, plus hands-on tools for getting started, minimizing risk, and maximizing success, you&#39;ll discover new ways to radically improve your life both personally and financially. Isn&#39;t it time to recapture your time and your life?&lt;/p&gt;" />
