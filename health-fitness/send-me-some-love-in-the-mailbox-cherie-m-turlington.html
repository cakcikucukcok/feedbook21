This left an enduring record for their children, grandchildren, and future historians, of their loves, joys, sorrows, successes, and failures in life.This mode of communication is becoming increasingly rare, and we are losing a very personalized way of building deep relationships with our loved ones through the written word.I hope you find the joy of putting pen to paper, sharing your thoughts, loves, and the memorable moments of your life with those you hold dear.I hope you have a wonderful life filled with love letters from friends and family that hold the memories you cherish.I hope you discover the joy of love in the mailbox." />
