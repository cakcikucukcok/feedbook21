  <title>Fibromyalgia Demystified - Nicholas Stiles</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Fibromyalgia is a chronic medical condition that can be painful and exhausting to live with. People with this problem often have trouble getting through their day to day lives, especially if they have to deal with medical professionals who don&#39;t seem to understand and be knowledgeable of their condition. The good news is that while there is no cure for fibromyalgia, there are a number of options available to treat the symptoms. This book is designed to help you understand the condition and some of the lifestyle changes that can help you get back in control of your life. We&#39;ll take a look at the science behind fibromyalgia, who gets it, and how common this condition can be. You&#39;ll also get a look at some of the most common misconceptions about fibromyalgia, many of which are believed even by doctors. Once you understand the truth about how fibromyalgia works, we&#39;ll look at the process of getting an initial diagnosis, as well as some of the most common medical tests. You&#39;ll learn how these tests are normally interpreted and how to get a second opinion if you think your doctor isn&#39;t treating you correctly. This book will also cover the most common fibromyalgia symptoms and the many ways in which the condition can affect your life. From increased fatigue to difficulty with normal movement, people with this condition must often find ways to alter their routine to help them cope. Science is always advancing, however, and there are many treatments available. Both traditional and alternative medicine have options available to help you control your fibromyalgia symptoms and increase the quality of your life. We&#39;ll examine the most common treatments and lifestyle changes, along with any risks and side effects. We&#39;ll also take a look at potential changes in diet that could help you feel better and live more fully. When combined with the correct physical fitness program and other good lifestyle habits, a good fibromyalgia eating plan can make a difference." />
