  <title>Human in Person - Dr. N Prabhu Dev</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Life is a dream for the wise, a game for the fool and a comedy for the rich and a tragedy for the poor.
I have made an attempt to portrait life as you and I live and believe. This is purely my perception. I may be right or I may even be wrong. You may agree or agree to disagree. I believe that Life is a collection of experiences, ideas, education and events. The Game of Life is not a game of chess in the conventional sense. There are no players, and no winning or losing. Once the &quot;pieces&quot; are placed in position, the rules determine everything that happens later. Nevertheless, Life is full of surprises! In most cases, it is impossible to look at a starting position or pattern and see what will happen in the future. The only way to find out is to follow the rules of life. Life is just one example of a cellular automaton, In Life, as in nature, we observe many fascinating phenomena. Nature, however, is complicated and we aren&#39;t sure of all the rules. I believe in Study everything, join nothing. I am puzzled by &#39;civil war.&#39; How can a war be civil?" />
