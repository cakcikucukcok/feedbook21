  <title>Keeping 6 - Norman Sharkey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Keeping 6 is an in-depth description of addiction in all its stages, covering both low bottom, high bottom, and all bottoms in between. It also contains important tips on detection and prevention and possible intervention. Keeping 6 may not touch every addicts using patterns, but if someone feels that drugs are becoming a problem, they should be able to relate. Drugs are very sneaky and are constantly telling the user that there is very little problem, if any. The purpose of Keeping 6 is to allow drug users, as well as their loved ones, to make a determination, in concert with each other, that a problem exists. Relapses, which are considered part of recovery, are dealt with extensively in this book. There are many situations in an addicts life that can cause a relapse, but the most common cause usually revolves around sexual problems. Addicts are good at denying things, and this is an area where they are most vehemently in denial. Most will laugh off any talk about sex and incest and say that their relapse had absolutely nothing to do with sex, even to the point of becoming very angry at the suggestion. 
This book gives a step-by-step plan to those who are serious about ending addiction. What you have in this book is a picture into the dark side but also provides a real solution. Its easy to read, sometimes funny and sometimes sad but always hopeful.
