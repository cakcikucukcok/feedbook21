  <title>A Life of Abuse - Christy M</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;A Life of Abuse&lt;/i&gt; shares the heartbreaking, brutally honest story of two little girlssisters--who were abused by their father and had to live with that abuse every day of their lives. They should have been surrounded with unconditional love and support from their mother and father. Instead their mother turned a blind eye as their father abused them every chance that he got. Even their friends were at risk in their home; their father was an abusive alcoholic who did not care who he hurt.
The sisters thought that there was no way out, but they discovered that there was life after the abuse and that no one should ever give up. Many times, they wanted to break down and give up; even so, they found ways to get through the difficulties they experienced resulting from their childhoods. They now live good and happy lives. 
There are others living with and through abuse today. Christy M. wants to reach out and inspire these others to hold onto their faith and believe that there is hope. They can be strong, and they can make it through to a happier life." />
