  <title>A Practical Guide for Raising a Self-Directed and Caring Child - Louis J. Lichtman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Countering the Tiger Mother parenting style, this research-based, practical guide provides an excellent framework for raising competent and compassionate children.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In an era of helicopter parentsmoms and dads who constantly hover over their children to monitor and manage their livesand our cultures focus on personal gain and corporate greed, there is great need for a parenting guide that outlines how to raise children who are well adjusted. &lt;i&gt;A Practical Guide for Raising a Self-Directed and Caring Child&lt;/i&gt; fills that void. In response to Amy Chuas recent bestseller, &lt;i&gt;Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother&lt;/i&gt;, psychologist Louis J. Lichtman, PhD, presents a compelling case for the notion that children will be more successful if they are self-directed rather than parent-controlled. Through anecdotes and research studies, Lichtman illustrates how to build a childs self-esteem and delves into how parenting styles and disciplinary practices influence a childs behavior and character.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Lichtman also gives special attention to the topics of achievement, parenting during the adolescent years, and how family structure impacts children. In addition, Lichtman discusses how to avoid common parenting mistakes, issues to consider before deciding to become a parent, and how to give children the best possible start in life.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Designed to help parents develop a set of guiding parenting principles, this guide is applicable to all situations and to children of all ages. &lt;i&gt;A Practical Guide for Raising a Self-Directed and Caring Child&lt;/i&gt; offers a solid, comprehensive resource for todays parents.&lt;/p&gt;" />
