&lt;i&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reflections&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Through the mirrors of my mind
Day after day
I see reflections of life itself
Reflections of all the days of old
I can see it as if it were today
When I was a slave and you
Were the boss
Yes, I must agree that times
Have changed but yet I am not free
It seems you still have a bond over me
Through the mirrors of my mind
As my heart pound
I see reflections of life today
Reflections of what life should be
Reflections of what it means to me&lt;/i&gt;" />
