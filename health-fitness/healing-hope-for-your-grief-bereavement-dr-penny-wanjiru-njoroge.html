  <title>Healing Hope for Your Grief &amp; Bereavement - Dr. Penny Wanjiru Njoroge</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dr. Penny has been a valuable asset to our Pastoral Care Team at St. Vincents East Hospital.  She works daily with patients who are suffering, to relieve 
their worry and fear and to remind them of the comfort of the touch of our Lord.  From this front line perspective, Dr. Penny brings her real world 
experiences to life in the work of Healing Hope for Grief and Bereavement.   Dealing with loss and the grief that flows from that is something we will all 
face.  As Dr. Penny does in her day to day, this work is meant to help those that will one day pass through those normal experiences of loss and to bring 
them out the other side through a remembrance of Christs promises through His scriptures.  As Dr. Penny writes..as God wraps His loving arms around us, 
we have the assurance of His faithful care.  I personally recommend this work for all who have experienced loss and are trying to cope with the road ahead.
