  <title>In My Quest For Personal Growth, The Rest Of Me Grew Too! - Toni Sorenson Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;SHIRLEY, YOU CAN DO IT!&lt;br&gt;What do you get when you combine a mother, a wife, and a friend, with a helping of humor, a smidgen of self-help, and a dash of dead-on wisdom?  You get &lt;b&gt;Shirley&lt;/b&gt;, a woman just like you: looking for answers, trying to stretch the 24-hour day a little bit longer, and constantly seeking to better herself, even when her &quot;self&quot; is just fine as it is.  Now, in this hilarious, home-hitting new series, you can follow Shirley through the adventure that is daily life--and you just might learn a few things about yourself along the way...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IN MY QUEST FOR PERSONAL GROWTH, THE REST OF ME GREW, TOO!&lt;br&gt;Shirley is dreading Mother&#39;s Day almost as much as she loathes hauling her very pregnant body to her son&#39;s school to be his show-and-tell exhibit.  But when she makes a new friend, who gives her a crash course in Life 101, Shirley views Mother&#39;s Day in a whole new light, and--even if her husband forgets to send her flowers and her mother-in-law gives her a copy of &lt;i&gt;Lose the Baby Fat Before the Kid is in Kindergarten--&lt;/i&gt;Shirley grows to realize that she is truly blessed.&lt;/p&gt;" />
