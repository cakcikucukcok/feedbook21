  <title>All About Children – Questions Parents Ask - Tony Humphreys</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Being a parent is more challenging today than it’s ever been. In &lt;i&gt;All About Children&lt;/i&gt;, this thoroughly reliable and effective handbook, clinical psychologist Dr Tony Humphreys outlines effective ways of parenting and positive responses to difficult behaviour by children.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes the task of parenting seems overwhelming. At others it provides great fulfilment and joy. It is always unpredictable; the challenges are forever changing and much of what we might have learned from our own parents seems quite irrelevant now. Parenting is not learned by instinct; it requires many complex skills. Parents have responsibility for the physical, emotional, social, sexual, behavioural, educational, creative and spiritual development of their children, and at the same time they must love them unconditionally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tony Humphreys recognises the many and varied challenges faced by parents today. In &lt;i&gt;All About Children&lt;/i&gt;, he provides an invaluable resource for parents by taking the questions they most frequently ask and providing thoughtful and comprehensive answers. He begins by pointing out that in order to develop parenting skills, each parent must first understand themselves and be prepared to continually update their knowledge as the needs of their children alter as they grow older. He goes on to deal with the practical aspects of everyday parenting skills and then looks at different aspects of challenging behaviour, both by children and parents. The book concludes with a chapter on learning and education, two core concerns of every parent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a helpful question-and-answer format, &lt;i&gt;All About Children&lt;/i&gt; provides today’s parents with not only the vital information they require but also points out the skills they need to carry out their demanding task effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;i&gt;All About Children&lt;/i&gt;: Table of Contents&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;Introduction&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Where does parenting begin?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What roles do parents need to play?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are the skills needed for everyday parenting?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How can parents best respond to children’s challenging behaviours?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How can parents resolve their own challenging behaviours?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How can parents prepare children for living their lives fully?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
