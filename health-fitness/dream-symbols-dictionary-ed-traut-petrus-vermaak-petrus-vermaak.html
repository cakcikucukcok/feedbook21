  <title>Dream Symbols Dictionary - Ed Traut, Petrus Vermaak, Petrus Vermaak</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;New Digital Edition with Hyperlinks for easy navigation!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Dictionary includes hundreds of dream symbols along with positive and negative interpretation meanings and scripture references.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This dictionary is designed to be only a helper and guideline and not a complete lexicon.&amp;nbsp; Please understand that there is no way that anybody could make a complete, perfect collection of dictionary symbols because objects in dreams can mean multiple things to you.&amp;nbsp; This holds true for colors as well, depending upon the circumstances and situations in the dream.&amp;nbsp; We give here some guidelines of some common objects,&amp;nbsp; colors, people etc. that we hope will be a blessing to you. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you find something in this dictionary that is listed as meaning one thing, always stay open to the Lord showing you that it may reflect something else in your life.&amp;nbsp; For instance, a dog returns to its vomit.&amp;nbsp; It is also a dog that is outside of the promised land in Revelation.&amp;nbsp; However, we also know that in our personal lives, dogs can be at times, a man&amp;rsquo;s very best friend.&amp;nbsp; Therefore, we have to not only use scripture along with this dictionary, but also make sure that we understand what that object or person could actually mean to us. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Start out with this dictionary and then stay open to expanding your understanding from there.&amp;nbsp; We pray that you will be blessed with more understanding daily and that the Lord will use this Dream Symbols Dictionary to deepen your discernment with every dream you interpret.&lt;/p&gt;" />
