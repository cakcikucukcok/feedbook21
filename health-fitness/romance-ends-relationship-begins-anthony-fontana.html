  <title>Romance Ends, Relationship Begins - Anthony Fontana</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My primary purpose in writing this book was to share the knowledge that my wife and I learned about relationships after having attending a Marriage Encounter Weekend. We also were involved preparing couples for marriage for over twenty-five years at our parish. What I discovered was that our society does not provide a proper preparation for the seriousness of a marriage commitment. I believe the title of my book is enough to arouse some interest for we have all learned that we fall in love and can just as easily fall out of love. What I am presenting is a step by step assistance that anyone can employ to move from that initial state of romance to a solid relationship. There is a wide gap between a foundationless rapport with a partner and one that involves a solid effort from both.
Some of the basic principles I emphasize are aimed at your awakening to the fact that in order to truly relate with another you must first know yourself. Once that is established you will be ready to be more intimately involved with each other. I present my own relationship as an unending journey where we are confident enough to reveal ourselves on a deeper level of communication.
In order to attain the willingness and security we will need to accept the real meaning of love, we need to learn to focus on the present, accept any change that pops up and eventually realize that the power of our relationship with our loved one has an effect on those that may cross our path." />
