  <title>The Unwritten Rules of Social Relationships - Temple Grandin, Sean Barron</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Silver Silver Award Winner in the 2005 ForeWord Book of the Year Awards! Born with autism, both authors now famously live successful social lives. But their paths were very different. Temple&#39;s logical mind controlled her social behavior. She interacted with many adults and other children, experiencing varied social situations. Logic informed her decision to obey social rules and avoid unpleasant consequences. Sean&#39;s emotions controlled his social behavior. Baffled by social rules, isolated and friendless, he made up his own, and applied them to others. When they inevitably broke his rules, he felt worthless and unloved. Both Temple and Sean ultimately came to terms with the social world and found their places in it. Whether you are a person with autism, a caregiver in the autism community, or just someone interested in an outsider view of society, their powerful stories will enthrall and enlighten you.
