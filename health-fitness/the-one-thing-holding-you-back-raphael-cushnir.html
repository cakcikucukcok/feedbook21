  <title>The One Thing Holding You Back - Raphael Cushnir</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;By the time you finish this book, there will be nothing holding you back.&quot;&amp;#8212;from the Introduction&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people have a vision for their lives that they&#39;re not pursuing, half-heartedly pursuing, or pursuing with all their might yet somehow falling short. This vision can be modest or grand. It may involve breaking free of a destructive habit or finding a truly healthy relationship. It might have to do with making a real difference in the world or helping to lead a company to extraordinary success. In &lt;em&gt;The One Thing Holding You Back&lt;/em&gt;, Raphael Cushnir, a leading voice in the world of personal and professional development, reveals that whenever people aren&#39;t living their dreams it&#39;s because they&#39;re not yet willing and able to feel specific emotions related to those dreams. Once we access and understand these emotions, our dreams can and will come true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cushnir asserts that mere emotional awareness, commonly referred to as emotional intelligence, is not enough. For maximum benefit we must directly and consistently &lt;em&gt;connect&lt;/em&gt; with our emotions. In particular, we need to connect with the emotions we routinely avoid, resist, or attempt to dismiss. It&#39;s these emotions that possess the key to our greatest goals. And learning to connect with them is another rarely taught but essential skill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The One Thing Holding You Back&lt;/em&gt; provides real solutions that can be implemented immediately and without external support and includes true stories of people who have put Cushnir&#39;s process to work and transformed their lives. Delivering a step-by-step program in accessible language, this landmark book will turn the obstacles in front of us into tremendous opportunities for achieving the life we always wanted. &lt;/p&gt;" />
