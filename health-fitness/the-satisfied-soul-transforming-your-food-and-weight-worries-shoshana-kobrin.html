  <title>The Satisfied Soul: Transforming Your Food and Weight Worries - Shoshana Kobrin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Is food your enemy and your best friend? Do you ever wonder what your endless struggle with weight and appearance is really all about? 
It&#39;s the soul, not the body, that&#39;s starving
       Discover the underlying causes of food and 
weight issues, create a healthy relationship with food and your body, and nourish your starving soul.
   SHOSHANA KOBRIN has helped countless women cut the cords of their struggle with food and weight. The Satisfied Soul is vividly illustrated by characters based on poignant stories of women in her psychotherapy practice, and her own long history of bulimia. You&#39;ll be encouraged by these courageous women who conquered obsessive dieting, bingeing, compulsive overeating, overweight, obesity, bulimia, and anorexia. The Satisfied Soul goes beyond  dead-end diet plans with practical tools and a stirring, inspirational approach.
  Most approaches to overweight, body image concerns, and eating disorders follow the medical model  - dieting, attempts to correct negative thought patterns, and strictly monitoring eating habits. That model addresses only symptoms, not fundamental causes. The Satisfied Soul offers you a new direction: exploring the emotional and spiritual state lying beneath your troubled relationship with food. This involves repairing the inner emptiness and learning to connect deeply with your needs and desires, with others, and with the world we live in.  
  You&#39;ll learn strategies to change your thoughts, feelings, and behavior about food and your weight. Understanding the deeper layers of your struggle, you&#39;ll be more accepting of yourself and your body. This means eventually losing weight, if you need to, but more important, releasing your preoccupation with food. Let The Satisfied Soul guide you through the passages of change and growth to manifest your gift of transformation. 
Move from the Dark Spiral of despair about food and weight to the Land of Possibility where each day is a treasure!" />
