  <title>Healing Hepatitis &amp; Liver Disease Naturally - Peter Oyakhire</title>
      <meta name="description" content="LIVE YOUR LIFE EXPECTANCY WITH CHRONIC LIVER DISEASE. 
Studies show that all wellness traditions except western medicine offer detoxification and toxic waste management as a means of natural healing. Using the principles of natural healing and detoxification, Dr. Alexis Carrel, a Nobel Prize winner kept chicken heart alive for 38 years. He believed that cells could live indefinitely and that the secret of life is to feed nutrients to cells and to saturate the cells with Oxygen. If you can&#39;t get nutrients into the cells and you don&#39;t remove the toxins, the cells will be poisoned by their own waste products. He had found the secret to ageless body and timeless health. 
Often overlooked is the pain associated with orthodox management of infective and degenerative liver diseases and the promise alternative remedies have to offer. The question often asked is which herbs and nutrients are crucial to my healing? How much should I take? What about the latest infomercial? And who can we believe with so many choices out there? 
DID YOU KNOW THAT? 
Thirty million Americans have liver disease. Liver disease is the fourth leading cause of death in America. Over 550,000 people die world wide from liver cancer each year-a preventable complication of liver disease. One in one hundred thousand Americans have a truly functional liver. Each year, 25,000 Americans die from liver cancer. Liver cirrhosis is the seventh leading cause of death in America.
