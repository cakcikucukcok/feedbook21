  <title>Rays of Sunshine Revised and Expanded - Don Sucio</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Rays of Sunshine Revised and Expanded is a unique collection of health facts along with a bundle of poems.  This book was written to promote healthy lifestyles and habits.  It offers helpful advice for people who are struggling with health problems such as obesity, diabetes, and heart disease, in order to prolong their lives and revive their over-all well-being.  There is an emphasis on health tips, dietary advice, and mental health to recognize common health problems in order to restore wholeness in the readers&#39; lives.  
The poetry sections encourage wholesome family relationships, inspire good moral values and entertain readers with stimulating ideas.  An assemblage of spiritual poems advocates readers to establish and strengthen their relationship with God.  In a world filled with danger, diseases and doubt --these poems provide comfort, reassurance and optimism to every day people.
This book is important because a person&#39;s health and body are the only two things someone will have with them from the cradle to the grave.  True happiness is found in positive, long-lasting relationships --not money or material things.
The information and poems in this book offers readers productive possibilities to change their lives and improve their health.  Like bright, shining rays of sunshine, this book is intended to restore broken relationships, repair and sustain physical, mental and spiritual health, and rouse provoking thoughts to urge readers to ponder the direction of their lives while they think of ways they can improve themselves." />
