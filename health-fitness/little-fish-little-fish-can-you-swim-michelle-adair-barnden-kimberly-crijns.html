  <title>“Little Fish…Little Fish”..... “Can You Swim?” - Michelle Adair Barnden, Kimberly Crijns</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Awesome Facilities, Awesome teacher. Its like being with a baby whisperer. Michelle has brought out the best in my sons.- Debbie, Sampson &amp; Walter Gee. Darwin N.T.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;From day one, Michelle has been absolutely fabulous with Ashley. Her teaching skills are extremely high, and she has a wonderful connection with children that makes them feel at ease &amp; safe. The difference in Ashley in the water from coming here is the greatest. A big Thank-You to a wonderful lady. - Rhonda Smith. Darwin N.T.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;I cannot believe the changes in my boys in just a matter of weeks!! I am so happy with the work Michelle has done, in such a short time!! The boys love coming for their lessons, And I will surely be recommending you to everyone. - Lisa, Khane &amp; Hunter. Darwin N.T.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Without a doubt, Michelles swimming classes were the cornerstone of my boys swimming journeys. The passion &amp; experience that was conveyed in Michelles classes has enabled them to be competent and confident swimmers. After learning to swim, the advancement in other areas of my childrens lives has been quite profound, a quiet confidence has materialised. - Clare, Jimmy &amp; Flynn Darwin N.T.&lt;/P&gt;" />
