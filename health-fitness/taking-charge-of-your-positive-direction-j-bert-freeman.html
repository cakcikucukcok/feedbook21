  <title>Taking Charge of Your Positive Direction - J. Bert Freeman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is about handling personal and professional relationships in a positive direction. It contains skills and approaches that you can use right away when you interact with other people, at work, at home, at school and at play. The skills and approaches are called Consistent Positive Direction. 
&lt;p&gt;
This book can be your Consistent Positive Direction coach and guide. It contains all of the core skills and the major advanced skills and approaches for you to understand how to interact with anyone in a positive direction, including choices and alternatives that expand your options. Best of all you can always be yourself. There are numerous examples and exercises to help you. 
&lt;p&gt;
Chapters 1, 2 and 3 will provide you with the core know-how to use Consistent Positive Direction in any situation. The rest of the book advances your skills. Consequently, with practice you will be well equipped to use multiple approaches of Consistent Positive Direction in everyday life. Yet, the book acknowledges that &lt;i&gt;you can take charge of what you say and write&lt;/i&gt;. 
&lt;p&gt;
Among the skills and approaches that are expressed in this book, some are called &quot;Power Options&quot;. Power Options are approaches for many of the verbal and written encounters that we have in our lives. Many of them connect to what you already know. With the infusion of Consistent Positive Direction, they are connected to human experiences, stories and observations. Hence, you will encounter a number of approaches that include &quot;catchy&quot; acronyms or names such &lt;i&gt;as the MC, Mo&#39;s Reality Check, CIC, Inside RAPPP, TOLL Free Openness&lt;/i&gt; and more. There are over 165 Power Options. Those that are included in this book expand your readiness for forward movement, resolving differences, finding solutions, building relationships, and making change work more easily, all in a positive direction." />
