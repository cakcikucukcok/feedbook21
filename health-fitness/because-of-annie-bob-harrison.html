When Bob retired from the armed forces, he and Annie decided to settle down and try to find the American dream in Wichita, Kansas. Things went well for a few years, and their two small antique businesses thrived. Then, on a warm summer day a stranger came out of nowhere, knocked on their door, and immediately transformed their lives into a clash of two worlds. The strangers name was blood cancer, full of chaos, evil, and the inhumaneversus love, compassion, hope, and faith. 
Through Bob, from his eyes as a loving caregiver, youll see the trauma, feel the pain, hear the laughter, and share in the love of two people that fought until the end. This is not an ordinary trail on a walk through cancer. Its a chronological journey from the beginning to the end, with an unlikely twist. Bobs hope and dream is that someone will learn from his experience and not have to relive this story. After all, its Annies storyBecause of Annie." />
