  <title>Dumb? Ask! - Jewel Richardson, Faye E. Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="WHY DUMB? ASK!
Dumb simply means you dont know the answer and when you dont know the answer you should ask!
Dumb? Ask! is meant to give you insight into what you are allowing in your life as far as your choice of a man and to share with you that you are not by yourself in this quest for love.  Often in relationships, people settle with a person they are not compatible with. Most times they dont realize this until they have given their whole selves to their significant other.   
Everyone deserves and should have a healthy love life; one that grows and gives back.  We want to empower you to stop holding the man in your life accountable for your choices. When you withstand and accept the wrongdoings in your relationship, thats on you.  When you justify his actions and compromise yourself worth to stay with him that is your choice.  You are allowing yourself to become psychologically conditioned and complacent to your circumstances.
Dumb? Ask! is a motivating journey. It challenges you to do some self reflection and ask yourself some tough questions.  These questions will ultimately unveil the answers that will empower you to change yourself, and hence, change your life.
Dumb? Ask! connects women everywhere regardless of age, race, education, social status, economic background, and experiences. It connects women to a shared platform that powers one voice.  It is a platform on which all can stand tall and proudly declare Never again!" />
