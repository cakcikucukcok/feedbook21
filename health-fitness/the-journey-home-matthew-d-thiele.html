  <title>The Journey Home - Matthew D Thiele</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Journey Home&lt;/em&gt; was born of over twenty&amp;nbsp;years experience of walking with those who are suffering.&amp;nbsp; It is designed to help you think through important things that we all needs to consider now,&amp;nbsp;but which many choose to&amp;nbsp;ignore until it&amp;rsquo;s too late...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book is for people in pain.&amp;nbsp; It is for people who are worried or sick. &amp;nbsp;It is designed to encourage, comfort, and to help you know that you are not alone.&amp;nbsp; It is made to give away or to be read with someone you trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book has words.&amp;nbsp; But if you don&amp;rsquo;t like words, enjoy the pictures!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &amp;#39;seven reflections&amp;#39; at the start gently deal with critical grief issues that those approaching death often face. They use the framework of Christ&amp;#39;s journey&amp;nbsp;to help us through the&amp;nbsp;important things we each need to face on our journey. &amp;nbsp;The last two thirds of the book contain a collection of reflections, quotes and prayers that can be used individually without having to read the whole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Journey Home is written from a Christian point of view. &amp;nbsp;It also&amp;nbsp;makes use of key psychological insights into the grief process of those who are dying. It attempts to remain sensitive to those of different perspectives, but unashamedly talks of the &amp;#39;Fellow Traveller&amp;#39;, Jesus who goes with us and ahead of us. &amp;nbsp;It is our hope that The Journey Home will be of help to anyone on the journey of life. &amp;nbsp;Journey well!&lt;/p&gt;" />
