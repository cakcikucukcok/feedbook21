  <title>The Toxin Solution - JOSEPH PIZZORNO</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Eliminate avoidable toxins, mitigate the effects of those you can&amp;#8217;t avoid, and enjoy a longer life with this essential health guide from a pioneer in integrative medicine, Dr. Joe Pizzorno&amp;#8212;the author, teacher, practitioner, and founder of Bastyr University, the country&amp;#8217;s first and largest fully accredited university of natural medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Joe Pizzorno is convinced that lifelong good health rests on two key determinants: your exposure to toxins and your ability to process them in your body. While lifestyle, diet, and genetics all play a major role in well-being, many symptoms of declining health and chronic disease are rooted in toxic overload&amp;#8212;our exposure to a barrage of chemicals, heavy metals, radiation, electromagnetic frequencies, and pollution that are the byproducts of modern life. While the human body has an innate capacity to detoxify, it cannot cope with the elevated levels of toxins we are exposed to today. Most alarmingly, this toxic overload has helped transform once rare diseases into epidemics affecting people of all ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The Toxin Solution&lt;/em&gt;, Dr. Pizzorno provides the proven detox and tailored methods he has developed to heal toxic overload and restore health in just eight weeks. With this essential guide you will learn how to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid toxins in food and the products you use;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mend your gut and prepare for detox;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Support your body in releasing the chemicals;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Repair some of the damage toxins have caused.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, our bodies have a tremendous capacity for healing and recovery.
