  <title>Mirrors - Doug Watson, Frannie Watson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;MIRRORS&lt;/i&gt; explores the life stories of three real people. The author weaves together the individual stories and invites the reader to identify with these tales. The reader is offered the opportunity to use the actions and feelings of the characters to help examine his or her own emotions and choices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The character, Jacob, enjoys his job and he has great friends, but everyday he comes home to turmoil and dark thoughts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Jacob, we ask ourselves, Does the average person obtain peace in life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;HOW CAN PEACE COME OUT OF CHAOS?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Mirrors&lt;/i&gt; the reader is challenged by questions and observations of the characters lives. Emotional issues such as codependency and addiction are recognized as unhealthy behaviors. Basic emotional concepts revealed through the characters may help mirror aspects in your own life. As the reader identifies with the characters they will have the opportunity to reflect on issues in their own experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identification with these reflections make &lt;i&gt;Mirrors&lt;/i&gt; a different kind of self-improvement book. Through self-examination hopefully the reader can catch a glimpse in the mirror and see a healthier future of greater peace and joy in life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
