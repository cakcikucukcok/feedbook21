  <title>The ,000 T-Shirt - Devon Weaver</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Have you ever felt like you were failing as a parent? &amp;nbsp;Me too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a random moment together in the kitchen, my wife asked me what I was teaching our two kids. &amp;nbsp;The question ran through me like a 12-gauge shotgun slug. &amp;nbsp;Immediately, I did what I always did: backpedaled and played defense. &amp;nbsp;After some quiet time and reflection though, I let go of the ego trip; she was right. &amp;nbsp;I wasn&amp;rsquo;t teaching them anything other than potty humor (poop jokes are hilarious though.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was mad at myself. &amp;nbsp;Mad at the world. &amp;nbsp;The same things I hated in my Dad - the silence, keeping all the wisdom and honesty inside - were the same things I was doing to my kids. &amp;nbsp;I was failing as a father, just as mine had done to me. &amp;nbsp;Nope. &amp;nbsp;No more. &amp;nbsp;The generational bad habits stopped here. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When enough time passed, and the statute of limitations on my wife&amp;rsquo;s idea ran out, I decided to do something about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The task was difficult; the obstacles, many. &amp;nbsp;For the love of his kids, a spreadsheet guy was forced to play in the literary world. &amp;nbsp;The $20,000 T-Shirt is the response to my shortfall as a parent. I&amp;rsquo;m passing down to my kids what I know to be true, not out of moral obligation, but out of love.&lt;/p&gt;" />
