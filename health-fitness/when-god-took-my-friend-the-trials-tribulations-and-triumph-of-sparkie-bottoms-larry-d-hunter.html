  <title>When God Took My Friend &amp; the Trials, Tribulations, and Triumph of Sparkie Bottoms - Larry D. Hunter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Essence of this Book
This book is about losing that very very special loved one in your life!  Sometimes its more that one person you have lost to the monster of death.  However, as Christians we are promised victory over death, even as our forerunner Jesus Christ  having conquered death through his all powerful resurrection, which assures us of victory over death as well.
Knowing this gives us hope as we look upon the frail body of the one we love so dear, as they venture through the pathway to deaths awaiting arms.  We are comforted in the fact that Jesus takes away the sting of death for all His children, though to us it looks excruciatingly painful, ugly, gross, and so very unlovely.
The great monstrosity death with a all that it has brought to us in life as Christians shall be swallowed up in victory!  And we all shall shout even as our LORD! O grave where is thy victory!  O death!  Where is thy sting?  But thanks be to God Who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.  (1 Corinthians 15.51-58).  This book reveals the happiness and joy you can have even though sickness, pain, heartache, lonely nights, suffering, loss of a dear loved one in this life, yet, in spite of it all you can live the victorious life because you are in the everlasting hand and arms of your loving savior Jesus Christ.  (John 10.28 &amp; 29, Deut. 33.27).
Friend, God is our dwelling place and underneath us are His everlasting arms of love, even in our trouble and trials that strength and love remains.  I saw that in losing two wives one to Lupus, and one to breast cancer.  Yet their joy and victory stayed intact and remained.  Both were awesome women of God in this 21st century.
Read on and be immensely blessed by their lives and their circumstances as they eventually faced what many are facing throughout America, the world, and perhaps in your family the monstrosity called death.  God gives victory, joy, peace, care, and love, amidst the pain and sorrow we face.  He is a loving God.  He is a caring God.  He is the omnipotent God, from all our births until we all reach immortality at His coming through His Son Jesus Christ!
