  <title>Parenting a New Paradigm - Lightsong</title>
      <meta name="description" content="We live in intense and transformative times, as humanity is experiencing a consciousness metamorphosis. Deeply suppressed individual and collective traumas and polarized dynamics between good and bad/ light and shadow are emerging in order to be witnessed and finally healed. The entire vibratory field of creation is transforming. 
Most children are born with the new morphogenetic blueprint of Unity Consciousness. In order for these unique vibrational harmonics to activate and physicalize, every child needs an environment that supports the blossoming of their innate Divine Nature. It is our childrens calling to live the simplicity and beauty of life in cosmic Oneness instead of shouldering the past of their parents and mankind. 
PARENTING A NEW PARADIGM is filled with inspirational insights to support parents, families, caregivers and humanity in shifting their perceptions regarding children and their interactions with them. 
The words resonate with deep, transformative energies, bringing healing to the inner children of adults. 
Together, we can join our children to bring forward into realization a paradigm of individual fulfillment and global harmony." />
