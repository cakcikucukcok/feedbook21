  <title>Life Is What Happens ... at Play - Hannah Lee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Do you have relationship challenges? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marriage doldrums? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An unfulfilling career? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lack of passion, purpose, or fire in your life? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you faded away into the gray?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does any of this sound familiar to you? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life is What Happens  at Play is a bold out-pouring of soul and emotion. The author shares her innermost fears, personal mistakes, judgments, dysfunctional patterns, and finally her journey toward discovering enlightenment. The experiences she shares are woven around a timeline from childhood through marriage and divorce and are compiled from her various adventures as she seeks to find herself and her lifes purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are reading these words not by chance, but because you may be at a point in your life where you yourself are seeking to gain a deeper wisdom of whom you really are and what your higher purpose is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life is What Happens  at Play seeks to instill in you a new sense of hope and understanding as to your greater calling by turning on the light inside of you that may have been dimmed for too long and rediscovering the magic that your inherent inner child can bring to you. You may be surprised at just how easy it is!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I realize that I had, in a sense, been sleeping all those years and just dreaming I was awake.  I&#39;d always believed that a life of quality, enjoyment and wisdom were my human birthright and would be automatically bestowed upon me as time passed. I never suspected that I would have to learn how to live.&lt;/p&gt;
