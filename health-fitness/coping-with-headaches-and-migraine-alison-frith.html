  <title>Coping with Headaches and Migraine - Alison Frith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Headache and migraine affect more than 10 million people in the UK, two thirds of whom are women. They are one of the most common problems seen in doctors&#39; surgeries and emergency departments, and are a leading cause of absenteeism at work and school, affecting a staggering 90,000 people each working day. Migraine attacks may include a range of manifestations such as nausea, vomiting and hallucinations, and may be so uncomfortable as to bring life to a halt. Headaches are usually less severe and more localised. There are a number of causes and triggers including lifestyle, diet, stress, and hormonal fluctuations. In the past, migraine was something you just had to &#39;put up with&#39; and today many people do just still struggle on as best they can, or cope by drawing the curtains and going to bed. Nowadays, however, much can be done to manage and prevent migraine and other headaches, and this book explores these options. Topics include: Migraine and other types of headache Triggers and threshold; illness-related; genetic; stress, posture, environmental etc Keeping a headache diary Women and migraine/headache Help from your doctor; medications; specialist care; migraine clinics; investigating headache further (ie scans) Diet and lifestyle Complementary remedies, relaxation, breathing, meditation etc Research and the future" />
