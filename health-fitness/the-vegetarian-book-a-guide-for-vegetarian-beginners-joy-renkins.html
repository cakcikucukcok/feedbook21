  <title>The Vegetarian Book: A Guide for Vegetarian Beginners - Joy Renkins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Vegetarianism has become big business. The shelves of our supermarkets are full of products targeted at the vegetarian. They all look so convenient and most of us need to save time. We have been inevitably tempted to be a bit lazy sometimes and cut corners. But vegetarians have to be aware what is in those handy little packages or they could be putting their health at risk. So don&#39;t be a lazy vegetarian in the supermarket: read those labels. You need to check how much sugar is in the product, just how much fat and whether refined carbohydrates have been used. A small amount of refined flour, the occasional sweet or fatty treat aren&#39;t in themselves bad for a vegetarian. But these substances become a problem when they constitute a large part of the vegetarian diet. A good vegetarian can get fat should they eat enough fat, sugar and refined carbohydrate. As a vegetarian, you should train your palate and that of your children to expect less of these foods and the moment sugar rush that complements them." />
