  <title>Don&#39;t Just Breathe - John Graziano</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What if you were to adjust your course in life while you are living it -- where you don&amp;#39;t have to hit a wall before you change course?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After living a good portion of his life as an observer, author John Graziano began to reflect and look within himself. Eventually, realism kicked in. He grew aware that he, along with a good segment of our population, was living life with the constraints of social shackles. This caused him to view human behavior in an unconventional way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Don&amp;#39;t Just Breathe: Life Lessons from My Massage Table&lt;/em&gt; is a fundamental, straightforward approach to learn and laugh by examining our lives and emotional journeys using personal stories of inspiration that anyone can relate to -- no matter what age, gender, profession, or personality. It addresses a profound and prevalent phenomenon in our society: why so many people are unhappy. It gives glimpses into the lives of the author&amp;#39;s clients and the struggles they face -- often through entertaining anecdotes. It encourages you to look at your own life with a fresh lens, and it may even spark the necessary lifestyle adjustments you need to make.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A portion of the proceeds from this book will be donated to the following: Integrative Touch for Kids, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.IntegrativeTouch.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;www.IntegrativeTouch.org&lt;/a&gt; and National Alliance on Mental Illness Southern Arizona (NAMI), &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.namisa.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;www.namisa.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
