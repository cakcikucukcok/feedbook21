  <title>My Organic Baby - Pamela Marin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;My organic baby is a book that gives parents a complete guide, based on studies and scientific data. It confronts the facts and myths associated with the upbringing of a child in a natural, organic way: free of vaccines, free of chemicals and contaminants commonly found in standard food, hygiene and cleaning products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will know how to complement orthodox medicine with natural options, such as homeopathy, without the need to use harmful chemicals, and how to select healthy organic food for your baby and entire family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has recipes to get rid of common or conventional products, almost completely at home. As well as helping you improve your health before, during, and after pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pamela Marin talks about her own experience as a Hispanic woman and new mother. A mother from a new generation of informed parents who are seeking other options and do not conform to the norm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoy my story, as much as I enjoy it, and may it help you create that new baby that you expecting with a healthier and more informed perspective.&lt;/p&gt;" />
