  <title>The Ultimate Guide to College Safety - Peter J. Canavan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;College students and their parents used to worry about getting good grades, finding a job after graduation and whether or not they would be living at home after college. However, in recent years the primary concern has been ensuring that students stay safe at college while they are away from home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many safety challenges facing today&amp;#39;s students. This book addresses these topics including bullying &amp;amp; cyber-bullying, alcohol responsibility, credit card and ATM safety, dorm room security, personal boundaries, sexual and physical assault, terrorism, active shooters and personal safety both on and off-campus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The author is a computer consultant, martial artist, self-defense instructor, university public safety officer and campus security authority, as well as the father of three soon-to-be college students. He has extensively researched the problems facing today&amp;#39;s youth, brings awareness to them, and provides comprehensive, realistic solutions for college students who face threats that generations before never did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the obvious threats to personal safety, the book contains important information about how to build confidence, maintain the proper attitude, and build various other skills to ensure success both in college and in life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
