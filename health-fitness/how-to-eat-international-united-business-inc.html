      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;How to Eat : A New Proactive Diet Approach for a Better Life&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people do not know how to eat right. There are many pitfalls about foods in the modern environment. This book is a different kind of how-to-eat book that provides a new comprehensive guide to help individuals achieve advanced level of eating and life-long healthy weight.&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot;&gt;Most diet plans are not working for dieters because they only focus on foods and nutrients without consideration of habits and biology factors that are equally important in daily food choices. Suddenly including many new and unfamiliar foods in their daily diet and having to give up many familiar foods that they are used to eating for years is a major disruption both biologically and psychologically to dieters. Most dieters do not have enough willpower to sustain this kind of unnatural change demanded by these diet plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies found that the hormones in our body work against weight loss by increasing our craving for food and lowering the bodys metabolism rate when weight loss occurs. Many dieters have tried diet plans or quick-fix programs to lose weight often in a short period of time. By reviewing and analyzing 31 long-term diet studies rigorously, UCLA researchers concluded that over 83% of dieters regained most of the lost weight after two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot;&gt;This book offers a new proactive diet approach (PDA) based on foods, habits, and biology factors. PDA has four practical and effective strategies that people can easily adopt in their own pace, enjoy and get more out of their eating every day:&lt;/p&gt;
Eat the best foods
Avoid the worst foods
Achieve life-long healthy weight
Choose organic
&lt;p&gt;PDA offers a new paradigm to manage weight based on an individuals unique need and situation. Instead of a diet program that dictates what you eat, PDA lets you proactively make small and gradual changes based on your own pace that lead to habits that stick. No matter which strategy individual dieters choose to execute fully or partially, dieters are making positive progress toward the goal of healthy weight. PDA does not cause stress or guilt that is commonly associated with other diet programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wellbeing is not just about weight loss, it is about the absence of disease, being free of pains, having youthfulness and longevity, your body being in a state with energy, having vitality, and being able to enjoy food and life to the fullest extent. This book provides a unique and potentially life changing how-to-eat approach to help you achieve the wellbeing that you want for your life.&lt;/p&gt;
