&lt;p&gt;Do you believe you should be over it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you considering seeing a therapist but believe you must be crazy to enter psychotherapy? Are you afraid to let a therapist know its been a very long time since you lost your loved one and you are still feeling lonely and devastated? Are you afraid a psychotherapist will judge youthat he or she may find out you are soothing yourself by some unacceptable behavior?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you stopped going to church? Cut yourself off from community and possibilities that have nurtured your spirit in the past? Are you just plain feeling badly about yourself?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever felt any of these things?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Myself Help&lt;/i&gt; is the story of anyone who has heard a critic in their mind, felt guilty about certain choices theyve made, or felt loneliness while surrounded by loved ones. Dana Anderson shares her personal story while providing helpful tools for growth and healing. &lt;i&gt;Myself Help&lt;/i&gt; is an inspirational tale told with humor.&lt;/p&gt;" />
