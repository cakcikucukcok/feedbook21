  <title>Power Parents - Kopo Doran, Kgosi Doran</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Times have changedrapidly and drastically. The 21st century is not the Botswana of even 15 years ago. Raising children in the age of HIV, AIDS and other Sexually Transmitted Illnesses (STIs) is tremendously challenging. More than ever it is crucially important for parents and parents-to-be to be fully aware of the needs of children and teens when considering issues of sexual health, illnesses and behavior.
WE CANNOT WAIT. Our children and teens need us NOW!
Todays parents cannot rely on the old ways of parental behavior. Th e Botswana cultural practice of parents not talking directly with their children, talking in metaphors, and avoiding issues of sexuality is no longer safe--the stakes are too high. It is too dangerous for our children to face the challenges of making smart sexual decisions without accurate information, sound guidance and strong moral principles. Each of us must become a Power Parent to our children. 
Students, you can help your parents now by reading and discussing this book with them. Also, many of you will become parents yourselves. You can prepare yourselves to be parents who give your children the best opportunity for health and success by understanding the dialogues suggested in this book.
A Power Parent utilizes the best of what is already known about raising children, while learning new ideas, approaches and techniques. Besides being a guide book, this is the story of Kefentse and Tsiamo. Their story provides a roadmap for parents in helping children grow into adults who are healthy, happy and confi dent in their roles as men and women.
Kefentse and Tsiamo have the same challenges that all parents and couples face. It
took courage on their part to become Power Parents, and the road was diffi cult. But lets begin their story................." />
