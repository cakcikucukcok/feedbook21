  <title>A Different Kind of Discipline - Tony Humphreys</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Discipline is a topical issue. It safeguards our rights as individuals and, without appearing to, impacts all our relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In this ground-breaking book, bestselling author and psychologist Dr Tony Humphreys addresses the many issues surrounding discipline in both the broad and immediate sense. With his usual clarity he helps define areas that have become confused in our rapidly changing and expanding society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A common misconception is that discipline applies only to children, but it is as much an issue for adults as it is for young people. It is not about controlling others, Dr Humphreys points out, instead it is about helping others to learn to control themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Discipline demands creativity, commitment and time. It is about parents, teachers, carers and communities working as partners. True discipline is not abusive, aggressive, cynical or manipulative. It is about clear communication, consistent application, adaptability, support and co-operation. Most of all it is about respect, acceptance and love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;In A Different Kind of Discipline&lt;/i&gt;, Dr Humphreys guides us through steps to create a positive environment in homes, schools and communities where mutual respect and thus discipline all have their place.&lt;/p&gt;" />
