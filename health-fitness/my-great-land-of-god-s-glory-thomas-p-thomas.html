  <title>My Great Land of God’S Glory - Thomas P Thomas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&#39;This powerful book portrays God&#39;s intense desire to restore glory on earth. Man lost God&#39;s glory, walking away from the Creator. God, having perfected atonement, goes after man, viewing mankind like they had never sinned. He equips man to regain lost glory by His Spirit and Word, through Christ-like living.&lt;p&gt;A stirring sense of purpose runs right through all twenty two chapters, although a wide spectrum of practical issues are addressed. Fresh
revelation on timeless truths, deeply probed and delightfully portrayed, inspire families to realign and nations to reform.&lt;p&gt;This sensational book makes a clarion call on all citizens everywhere to fulfill their mandate to flood their nation with the Creator&#39;s glory. The final pages are a saga of love for homeland, kindling a passion deep inside, to exalt its honour by a life of righteousness. A refreshing revelation of true patriotism, this timely book is a road map for all patriots, toward building a society and nation in oneness, without ripping it apart in religious fanaticism.&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;The truth herein is a fresh breath to timeless revelation from the heart of the Father. It is a must have for every marriage and home, in these days of hectic activities and heavy commitments&quot;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rev. Sam T Varghese, General Overseer, Apostolic Churches Alliance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;Rev. Thomas and Rachel have taken the high road, living out what they believe, modelling their lives to a generation looking for the real deal. He is a father for fathers and pastor for pastors and has mended many broken lives and ministries. His understanding on God&#39;s gift of righteousness is clear, powerful, grace-filled and balanced with the holiness of God. While many talk about grace, Rev. Thomas is one of the few who has preached grace with his life. This is a long-awaited book toward true understanding of God&#39;s heart and the power of His righteousness&quot;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. John Joseph, MBBS, E.MBA, Founding Minister, 
World Impact Community Church, Trivandrum, India&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;I am very impressed with the insights in this book, especially distinction between love and lust, the need for godly role models in fathers and the challenge to &quot;dare to father&quot;, the &quot;Jacob Generation&quot;, and teachings on being &quot;raised up and sent, not rose up and went.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Barbara M. Kohl, Barbara Kohl Ministries, Canada&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;God wants us to experience His Glory now on earth. We may seek it within the four walls of churches. This book inspires us to seek its expression everywhere. With great wisdom and insight, Rev. Thomas P Thomas reveals how Godly order in homes and personal lives, and little acts of honour and love for others become the pathway to the Church exploding in glory. This book is a catalyst for transformation.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diane Carroll, Freedom Encounters, NJ, USA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
