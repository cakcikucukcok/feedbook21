  <title>Aaliyah and Dad Go Fishing - Rk Simms</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Fishing with Aaliyah was great. Seeing her excitement even excited me! That entire day was a day of joy. From the time we waved goodbye to Mom and Aarron, to the time we came home with a pail full of fish, we have a fun filled day Ill never forget. Ill view this as one of our special days; like a daughter and Daddy day. Unfortunately, days like this are not often shared with many daughters and their Dads.
I can recall the many times my Dad took me fishing and the fun we had. I did the same with my three sons; whether at the local lake or at the New Jersey shore. Fishing proved to be a fantastic day out with Joshua, Kevin, and Terence, regardless how many fish we caught!
One of my greatest fishing excursions was when my wife Isabelle, several of our friends, and I went to the beach and fished off shore. We caught so many fish we ate fish for days! The main event was watching Isabelle reel them in. she walked out into the water, cast out with all her might, and by the time she backed up to the dry sand, she was reeling another one in! This was her first time fishing and she caught more fish than each of us so-called experts.
Fishing with Aaliyah was very similar. This was her first time too and she caught more fish that I did. I guess she has her mothers knack. I was thrilled to share this day with my daughter. Actually, having Aaliyah with me, made fishing that much more enjoyable. Although she caught more fish than I did, that beautiful sunny day, will be day, neither Aaliyah or I will ever forget.
