  <title>The Company We Keep: In Search of Biblical Friendship - Jonathan Holmes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Friendship. It&amp;rsquo;s one of the simplest of human relationships in comparison to marriage or family relationships, and yet it&amp;rsquo;s also one of the least understood and practiced. For all of our progress in making connections through Facebook, Twitter, and other social-media tools, people are consistently experiencing loneliness and growing disenchanted with the whole notion of friendship.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Could it be our understanding of friendship has been more informed by pop culture and social media, and less informed by the vision of friendship offered by Scripture?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Is it possible friendship exists for a greater purpose than my enjoyment and comfort? Is friendship more than just having some people to hang out with on a weekend, participating in a book club, or hitting the golf course together?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;These questions and more are answered in this book. Biblical friendship is first and foremost about a relationship with Jesus Christ. As you are brought into friendship and relationship with the Father, Jesus Christ calls you a friend! It is out of this friendship that our human friendships find their beginning and their purpose.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Aelred, a Cistercian monk who wrote a profound treatise on friendship, writes, &amp;ldquo;And so in friendship are joined honor and charm, truth and joy, sweetness and good-will, affection and action. And all these take their beginning from Christ, advance through Christ, and are perfected in Christ.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is the core of biblical friendship, and what sets it apart from what the world is offering: it all flows from Jesus Christ. Friendship finds its origin, purpose and power in Jesus. Our human friendships then must be shaped by this life-changing truth.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Biblical friendship is deep, honest, pure, transparent, liberating&amp;hellip;and attainable.&amp;nbsp;Dig into this book, and find how your friendships can embody this amazing and wonderful truth.&lt;/p&gt;" />
