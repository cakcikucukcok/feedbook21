  <title>The Caretaker of All Souls: An Intimate Interview with Death - M.D. Cristina Carballo-Perelman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cristina Carballo-Perelman, M.D. has been a physician for over 30 years, providing care and comfort to many of her patients as they take their last breath.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In her book, &lt;em&gt;The Caretaker of All Souls: An Intimate Interview with Death&lt;/em&gt;, Death takes center stage as the commentator of the experiences that she, as a physician, has had with Death throughout her career.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The persona of Death is examined as is the role it plays as caretaker of the Soul.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This book offers a powerful message that Death brings love and compassion to the Soul as it travels to it&amp;#39;s next destination.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The questions asked of Death and Death&amp;rsquo;s answers explore many topics, including how Death has been viewed throughout history and by different religions. The questions also explore sensitive topics. These include but are not limited to: how Death deals with the Souls of those who have committed suicide, died by means of euthanasia or succumbed to dementia. The death of pets and all living things is also discussed by Death.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This book is meant to finally showcase Death, not as a villain, but as a partner with the Higher Source, full of light and love. It is meant to bring hope to those who are grieving and those who are fearful of the last journey of this life.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
