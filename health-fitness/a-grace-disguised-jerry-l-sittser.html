  <title>A Grace Disguised - Jerry L. Sittser</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With vulnerability and honesty, Jerry Sittser walks through his own grief and loss to show that new life is possible - one marked by spiritual depth, joy, compassion, and a deeper appreciation of simple blessings.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loss came suddenly for Jerry Sittser. In an instant, a tragic car accident claimed three generations of his family: his mother, his wife, and his young daughter.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While most of us will not experience such a catastrophic loss in our lifetime, all of us will taste it. And we can, if we choose, know the grace that transforms it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Grace Disguised&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;plumbs the depths of our sorrows, whether due to illness, divorce, or the loss of someone we love. The circumstances are not important; what we do with those circumstances is. In coming to the end of ourselves, we can come to the beginning of a new life.&lt;/p&gt;" />

He holds a master of divinity degree from Fuller Theological Seminary and a doctorate in the history of Christianity from the University of Chicago. He is the author of several books, including A Grace Disguised and The Will of God as a Way of Life.<br /><b><i>A Grace Disguised: How the Soul Grows through Loss ...</i></b> | Jerry Sittser is not only a survivor of sudden and multiple losses but a gifted writer. His style is beautiful and soothing, his aesthetic authentic. My copy of A Grace Disguised is so lovingly worn out and underlined that I simply sit down now and mail out a copy to a friend in need now from Amazon.<br /><b><i>A Grace Disguised: How the Soul Grows Through Loss ...</i></b> | A Grace Disguised transparently shares wise life-lessons and perspectives he learned…and is learning. Rather than give fixed answers, he deals more with values and perspectives. This makes the book so superb for those who have gone through crushing tragedy in their past or to prepare for the future.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>A Grace Disguised - Jerry L.
