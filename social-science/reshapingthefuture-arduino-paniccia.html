  <title>ReshapingTheFuture - Arduino Paniccia</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Having a strategy means finding solutions to the complexity of the global world.
The task of this manual is pointing out a possible method to transform the future to our advantage and seize also economic and financial opportunities crucial to emerge in the global competition.
The book provides an analysis of the evolution of strategic thought and method, from the dawn of nation-states until the civil war in Syria.
What happens in this country is emblematic of the change in perspective and power in recent years. With the “preventive war” the West had come to the borders of India, but today we see the Chinese military presence in the Mediterranean. The structure of global power is increasingly oligarchic, Asian and present in a wider area. A triad that bears the names of the US, Russia and China. Europe is witnessing an inert vacuum created in the South, across the Mediterranean and North Africa. The old continent is in decline, and doesn’t have a real strategy.
?Part One: Introduction
Part Two: History of Strategy (From the Sixteenth to the Eighteenth Century, Napoleon, Clausewitz, the Nineteenth Century, The First World War, The Second World War, The “Cold War”, The Unipolar Twenty Years)
Part Three: The Current Phase of Transition towards a New Strategy (An oligarchic Future, The Higher Triad, The Lower Triad)
Part IV: Conclusions (A New Definition of Strategy, Strategy and Conflict in a “Post-Heroic” Future, The Islamic World, An Eastern and Clausewitzian Conclusion).
??Arduino Paniccia (Milan, January 31, 1946) is an Italian columnist, writer and Professor. Analyst of military strategy and geopolitics, he has written numerous articles and publications that make it an expert in Italian and international level. He currently teaches Strategic Studies at the University of Trieste (at Gorizia) in the course in International and Diplomatic Sciences.
