  <title>Race and Crime - Elizabeth Brown, George Barganier</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;I&gt;Race and Crime: Geographies of Injustice &lt;/I&gt;examines how and why racialized mass incarceration emerged as the newest racial management strategy in the U.S. and its impact on criminal justice institutions. Few books examine just how this came to be and even fewer take race as anything more than just a series of outcomes in the system. Using a macrostructural perspective, students will contextualize issues of race and crime in society today by being introduced to the history of colonial conquest and the emergence of the idea of race. They then consider how this idea transforms throughout history and impacts the creation of state power, the emergence of new state institutions, and geographies of racial segregation.&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;#160;&lt;BR /&gt; Topics include:&amp;#160;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;the authors&amp;rsquo; coined key term of &amp;ldquo;coloniality&amp;rdquo; to guide readers through the practices that reproduce racial hierarchies today&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;how geography plays a critical and necessary role in the continuation of mass incarceration and how ideas of space and place are critical forces within practices of racialization&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;the emergence of the logics of crime control, the war on drugs, the redefinition of federal law enforcement, and the reallocation of state resources towards prison building, policing, and incarceration&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;the role of courts in continuing the colonial order through practices of public defense, inadequate counsel, and tactics of spatial governmentality&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;BR /&gt; Through &lt;I&gt;Race and Crime, &lt;/I&gt;students will uunderstand how contemporary everyday practices of surveillance are employed in and through the police, courts, and punishment and how it shapes the geographical expression of injustice in the U.S. today.&amp;#160; &amp;#160;&amp;#160;&lt;BR /&gt;" />
