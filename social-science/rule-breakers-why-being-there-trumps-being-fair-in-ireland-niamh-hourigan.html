  <title>Rule-breakers – Why ‘Being There’ Trumps ‘Being Fair’ in Ireland - Niamh Hourigan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ireland is a nation on a value system that equates ‘being good’ with ‘being there for each other’. As a society we favour ‘minding our own’ over ‘doing what we’re told’. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So far, so Irish.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s become a commonplace to refer to the excesses of the Celtic Tiger years as an aberration, the product of a short-lived and inexplicable mania for cheap credit and unregulated consumption.
