  <title>One Nation Under Therapy - Christina Hoff Sommers, Dr. Sally M.D. Satel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Americans have traditionally placed great value on self-reliance and fortitude. In recent decades, however, we have seen the rise of a therapeutic ethic that views Americans as emotionally underdeveloped, psychically frail, and requiring the ministrations of mental health professionals to cope with life&#39;s vicissitudes. Being  &quot;in touch with one&#39;s feelings&quot; and freely expressing them have become paramount personal virtues. Today-with a book for every ailment, a counselor for every crisis, a lawsuit for every grievance, and a TV show for every conceivable problem-we are at risk of degrading our native ability to cope with life&#39;s challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drawing on established science and common sense, Christina Hoff Sommers and Dr. Sally Satel reveal how &quot;therapism&quot; and the burgeoning trauma industry have come to pervade our lives.  Help is offered everywhere under the presumption that we need it: in children&#39;s classrooms, the workplace, churches, courtrooms, the media, the military.  But with all the &quot;help&quot; comes a host of troubling consequences, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* The myth of stressed-out, homework-burdened, hypercompetitive, and depressed or suicidal schoolchildren in need of therapy and medication&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* The loss of moral bearings in our approach to lying, crime, addiction, and other foibles and vices&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* The unasked-for &quot;grief counselors&quot; who descend on bereaved families, schools, and communities following a tragedy, offering dubious advice while billing plenty of money&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* The expansion of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder from an affliction of war veterans to nearly everyone who has experienced a setback &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intelligent, provocative, and wryly amusing, One Nation Under Therapy demonstrates that &quot;talking about&quot; problems is no substitute for confronting them.&lt;/p&gt;" />
