  <title>The Human Saratani - Winston Shadrack Kangero</title>
      <meta name="description" content="White people are the benefactors of the ill-gotten gains by their ancestors through slavery, and land grabs/theft of the Americas and Australia. The insidious slave trade and slavery machinery saw the sweat and bloodshed of black people and Red Indians who were and still are the true Israelites, according to Jeremiah 14:2 (KJV), Jeremiah 8:21 (KJV), Song of Solomon 1:5 (KJV), Job 30:30 (KJV), and Lamentation 4:8 (KJV). The so-called African Americans and the blacks from Latin America and West Indies, Red Indians, Aborigines, and some of the blacks in Africa are the true Israelites, according to Deuteronomy 28:68 (KJV), not the so-called white Jews in Israel today. They are just imposters, or should I say in a more polite tone, they are converts who adopted the religion of Judaism, not the true Israelites according to the Bible. Yes, it does matter; such truth always matters. That is why it was hidden from us, and our schools will never teach you that truth because it serves the status quo. What I am talking about is written in the Tanakh, the so-called white Jewish Bible. This is the greatest secret of the centuries, revealed by God himself to his people. Do not hate the messenger but the Creator who sent the messenger. Do not believe me; do your own research. Thanks be to Jah, the Most High God, that most of us can read and write in this generation. We should use that gift wisely and not take it for granted. Do your own research; the Bible tells us to seek and we shall find. When I started, I did not expect to find out that Israelites are blacks, Aborigines, and Red Indians. It was a shock to me, but I could not deny the facts, Gods facts." />
