  <title>Spilling the Beans Too - Samuelin MarTinez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Imagine living in a world that hates you, and becoming aware of this witnessing how that hate hurts your mother daily.  At five I held my Ama&#39;s tired head and swore an oath, when I get big I will work hard so you won&#39;t be so tired.  Look through my lens, and see Corporate America exploiting and overexposing my mother to toxic waste, and toxic relationships stressing her native will to protect me from all that she suffered as a child.  
I invite you to consider my agony and adoring love that inspired this indictment; Corporate America killed my mother!  Cancer is not a normal death; it is murder because corporations know their waste is toxic.  I provide evidence, beyond a reasonable doubt, that our native maternal relationship was a military target for America to &quot;Kill the Indian save the child.&quot;  How can a country be so cruel, feel no empathy and deny there was a related American Holocaust?  I submit historical evidence that America is a socio-pathic mass murderer.
I also charge Corporate America with Child Abuse and Neglect, violating the United Nations Charter on the Human Rights of the Child.  The evidence, beyond a reasonable doubt, is the millions of homeless, hungry, sick and under educated children stressed, in the richest country in the world preying &quot;In God we Trust.&quot;  What is feigned love without justice or freedom?  A crime confusing profit with prophet.
For example, pediatrician Nadine Burke Harris explains that &quot;the repeated stress of abuse, neglect has real, tangible effects on the development of the brain. This unfolds across a lifetime with triple risk for heart disease and lung cancer.&quot;  The related Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) Study &quot;associations childhood maltreatment and later-life health and well-being.&quot;  Their focus is toxic parenting, mine is a toxic American history." />
