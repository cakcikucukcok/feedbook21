  <title>The Poet&#39;s Tree of Poetry - John Golden</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Insightful, amusing, endearing, playful and creative, these are just a few words that describe &lt;i&gt; The Poets Tree of Poetry&lt;/i&gt;. Written by John Golden, this exciting compilation shares an eclectic set of poems, quotations, pictures and inspiring words of wisdom. Profound and thought-provoking, the pieces in this read will motivate those who are seeking for lifes most valuable truths. 
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Many of the poems share symbolisms that will stir the human mind and allow the spirit to flourish. Rhythmic, the texts will blend into ones subconscious. Some points are blatant, straight-forward and filled with a feisty and dry sense of humor, which all the more enhances the authors provocative points. 
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Versatile, this selection is exceptionally rich with ideas. From the virtues of holding ones head up high and living a dignifying existence, to being genuine to ones own feelings and beliefs, this piece opens ones eyes to the many realities of the world inciting how the most important priority for one is the soundness of his soul and the clarity of his conscience. This compelling and artistically eccentric piece offers a myriad of life lessons that can be passed on from one readers generation onto the next." />
