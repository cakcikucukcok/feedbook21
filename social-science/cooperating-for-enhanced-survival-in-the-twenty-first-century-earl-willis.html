  <title>Cooperating for Enhanced Survival in the Twenty-First Century - Earl Willis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In Cooperating for Survival in the Positive-Sum Universe, Earl Willis proposed that the universe is actually causal and positive sum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This stance doesnt mesh with current scientific theories, but he argues we need to look at the universe in a new way. In this companion to his first book, Willis elaborates on his theory that the universe is real, rational, and causal, and under that basis he proposes the theory of contropy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This theory builds upon Darwins theory of evolution and further describes the evolutionary process to offer a new view of the world. It provides a simpler and more accurate description of reality than prevailing views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Willis argues that his theory explains the dichotomy of perspectives between many reasonable, intelligent people regarding political, economic, and even religious issues. These differences all hinge on whether someones fundamental point of view is individualistic or collectivist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get ready to explore the philosophical, political, and economic implications of the theory of contropy, and find out how we can work toward a more positive future by Cooperating for Enhanced Survival in the Twenty-First Century.&lt;/p&gt;" />
