  <title>110 Strategies for Success in College and Life - Mary Zahm, Joan H. Rollins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="110 Strategies for Success in College and Life shows students how their dreams can come true by using the skills derived from psychological science. It guides them to develop the attitudes, frames of mind, and beliefs that can help them achieve a life compatible with their personality, values, and interests. Knowing that many students are struggling financially, the authors of the book have made it affordable with the paperback and e-book one twentieth of the cost of other student success books currently on the market and even less expensive than some open source books.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The focus of the book is the individual student. Based on their many years of teaching psychology and advising and mentoring students, the authors provide beginning students with &quot;the rules of the game&quot; to help make college a smoother transition. The goal of the book is to help the student find out who they are and what they have to offer the world in order to select a major and future career path. This book encourages students to visualize their goals and then to have a step-by-step plan and the self-control and grit in order to achieve them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
110 Strategies for Success in College and Life is a valuable guide for freshman, whether coming right out of high school or after a hiatus of years working and/or taking care of a family. This book is particularly appropriate for minority and first generation college students who may have fewer mentors to help them along the college path. Each chapter offers case studies of successful students to serve as role models. The focus of the book is on the development of the student by providing them with skills necessary for both their academic life and their personal life within a framework of flexibility, integrity, enjoyment, and balance." />
