  <title>The Mysterious Collapse of World Trade Center 7: Why the Final Official Report about 9/11 is Unscientific and False - David Ray Griffin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;At 5:20 in the afternoon on 9/11, Building 7 of the World Trade Center collapsed, even though it had not been struck by a plane and had fires on only a few floors. The reason for its collapse was considered a mystery. In August 2008, NIST (the National Institute of Standards and Technology) issued its report on WTC 7, declaring that &quot;the reason for the collapse of World Trade Center 7 is no longer a mystery&quot; and that &amp;#147;science is really behind what we have said.&amp;#8221; Showing that neither of these claims is true, David Ray Griffin demonstrates that NIST is guilty of the most serious types of scientific fraud: fabricating, falsifying, and ignoring evidence. He also shows that NIST&amp;#8217;s report left intact the central mystery: How could a building damaged by fire&amp;#151;not explosives&amp;#151;have come down in free fall?&lt;/div&gt;" />
