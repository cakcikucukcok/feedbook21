  <title>Virginity Lost - Laura Carpenter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Nervous, inexperienced, confused. For most, losing your virginity is one of life&#39;s most significant moments, always to be remembered. Of course, experiences vary, but Laura Carpenter asks: Is there an ideal way to lose it? What would constitute a &amp;#8220;positive&amp;#8221; experience? What often compels the big step? And, further, what does &amp;#8220;going all the way&amp;#8221; really mean for young gays and lesbians?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this first comprehensive study of virginity loss, Carpenter teases out the complexities of all things virgin by drawing on interviews with both young men and women who are straight, gay or bisexual. &lt;b&gt;Virginity Lost&lt;/b&gt; offers a rare window into one of life&#39;s most intimate and significant sexual moments. The stories here are frank, poignant and fascinating as Carpenter presents an array of experiences that run the gamut from triumphant to devastating.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Importantly, Carpenter argues that one&#39;s experience of virginity loss can have a powerful impact on one&#39;s later sexual experiences. Especially at a time of increased debate about sexual abstinence versus safe sex education in public schools, this important volume will provide essential information about the sex lives of young people.&lt;/p&gt;" />
