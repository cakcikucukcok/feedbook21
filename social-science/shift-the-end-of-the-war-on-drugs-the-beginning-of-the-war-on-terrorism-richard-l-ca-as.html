  <title>Shift - the End of the War on Drugs, the Beginning of the War on Terrorism - Richard L. Ca単as</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A discerning Washington bureaucrat (there are a few) once professed that an accurate appraisal of government policies, laws, and procedures requires a thorough examination of the intent and context surrounding their enactment in the first place. A sage and logical deduction, right? Yet this guidance is so often ignored by the impatient.
The inimitable national security events described herein occurred over twenty years ago, a lifetime to some, just yesterday to others. The #1 national security concern of the United States government during the early 90s was the domestic threat posed by the illicit international drug trade. By comparison, the threat of foreign terrorism was considered a distant third or fourth on the priority scale. 
It was during this period of time that a mid-level Drug Enforcement Administration field Special Agent was detailed to the National Security Council staff and given the lofty title of Director for Counternarcotics. The assignment was designed to enhance DEAs influence at the policy level while providing policy-makers with valuable real world background information. The one year duty lasted four years and took the author, now the sole Director of Counternarcotics and Counterterrorism on the NSC staff, through a maze of inter-agency squabbles and national security policy inefficiencies. The authors last two years were the first two years of the William J. Clinton presidency and involved an unprecedented shift between the previous national security priority and a new emerging threat to the US. 
The account is a compelling narrative of the events that led to this shift and the often unmeasured consequences of inexperienced executives leading the development of national security policy. The lessons not-learned, admittedly with the invaluable assistance of hindsight, continue to effect the world we live in today." />
