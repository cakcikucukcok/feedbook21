  <title>Africa’s Last Romantic - Olga Brom Spencer, Glenn Reynolds</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;I&gt;Africa’s Last Romantic: The Films, Books and Expeditions of John L. Brom&lt;/I&gt; captures the drama and excitement of John L. Brom’s film expeditions from 1949 to 1962 through sub-Saharan Africa. Brom was the only explorer to follow the footsteps of Henry Morton Stanley and in a documentary interviewed the two last survivors of Stanley’s expeditions from 1874 to 1890. In 1955 he also interviewed the famous nineteenth-century East African slave trader Tippu Tip’s grandson, who defended his grandfather’s trade. Brom’s expedition was the basis for his bestseller &lt;I&gt;20,000 Miles in the African Jungle&lt;/I&gt;, which was translated into eleven languages. Brom managed to interview and film the rulers and tribes he encountered before they were decimated in the civil wars of the Congo after independence, and his historic films are now preserved in the Human Studies Film Archives of the Smithsonian Institution. Over 500 articles were published on Brom’s work on both sides of the Atlantic during his lifetime. &lt;I&gt;Africa’s Last Romantic&lt;/I&gt; is a useful addition to college courses in Third World cinema, cinema studies, and African history." />
