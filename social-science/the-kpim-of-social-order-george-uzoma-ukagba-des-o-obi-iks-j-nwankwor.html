  <title>The Kpim of Social Order - George Uzoma Ukagba, Des O. Obi, Iks J. Nwankwor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Frequently overlooked in the search of knowing and acting wisely are some important philosophical and cultural ideas and questions. The kpim of Social Order boldly captures such ideas and questions for awareness through critical thinking. The current volume in the Kpim Book Series makes the point that for a systematic analysis and significance of Social Order to be attained, we need to ask, What is the kpim or central core of Social Order of things? Where does the deepest layer, notion, symbolism, reality and application of social order, programs, human rights, institutions, communities, diplomacy, uprising, social asset, social power, policy action, inter-culturalism, global forces and all else lie? How can we reach and understand the innermost part of Social Order in the modern world? By gathering articles from seasoned, experienced, and emerged scholars from various backgrounds, the book explores deep-rooted questions touching on African context and related societies. The refreshing perspectives, analyses, deep reflections, vigorous arguments, and representations shown by the essays are distinctive and have been referred to as a comprehensive reader in the season of inquiry, meaning and significance of social order in the contemporary time. This is a book no one should ignore. Students, scholars, researchers, universities, colleges, educationists, institutions, policy makers, governments, legislatures, agencies, labour unions, civil society organizations, occupy movements, religious groups, entrepreneurs and the general public will find this book as an asset and a must read. The kpim of Social Order is therefore written out of the critical need to fill the gap for a decisive knowledge society in the modern world." />
