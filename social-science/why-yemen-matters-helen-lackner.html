  <title>Why Yemen Matters - Helen Lackner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In November 2011, an agreement brokered by the GCC brought an end to Yemen&#39;s tumultuous uprising. The National Dialogue Conference has opened a window of opportunity for change, bringing Yemen&#39;s main political forces together with groups that were politically marginalized. Yet, the risk of collapse is serious, and if Yemen is to remain a viable state, it must address numerous political, social and economic challenges. In this invaluable volume, experts with extensive Yemen experience provide innovative analysis of the country&#39;s major crises: centralized governance, the role of the military, ethnic conflict, separatism, Islamism, foreign intervention, water scarcity and economic development. This is essential reading for academics, journalists, development workers, diplomats, politicians and students alike. &#39;Essential reading … The authors shed light on the context of the Yemeni uprising in a way that not only helps us understand the current transitional period but also the outlines of Yemen&#39;s future.&#39; Charles Schmitz, President of the American Institute of Yemeni Studies &#39;An up to date and wide-ranging guide to what is arguably the Arab world&#39;s least known and most misunderstood state.
