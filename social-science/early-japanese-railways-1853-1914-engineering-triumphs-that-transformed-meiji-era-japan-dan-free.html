  <title>Early Japanese Railways 1853 - 1914: Engineering Triumphs That Transformed Meiji-era Japan - Dan Free</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;Early Japanese Railways 1853-1914&lt;/I&gt; is a cultural and engineering history of railway building in Japan during the Meiji era.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The importance of early railways in the industrialization of the United States and Europe is a fact all of us are familiar with. To witness the amazing parallel development of the railways in Japan, happening at much the same time as America was connecting its vast hinterland to the East and West coasts, is an eye-opening realization.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In &lt;I&gt;Early Japanese Railways 1853&amp;#8211;1914&lt;/I&gt;, Dan Free tells the fascinating story of the rise of Japanese rail amidst a period of rapid modernization during Japan&#39;s Meiji era. Leaving behind centuries of stagnation and isolation, Japan would emerge into the 20th century as a leading modern industrialized state. The development of the railways was a significant factor in the cultural and technological development of Japan during this pivotal period. Free&#39;s rare photographic and historical materials concerning Japan&#39;s early railways, including a print showing the miniature steam engine brought to Japan by Admiral Perry aboard his &quot;Black Ships&quot; to demonstrate American superiority, combine to form a richly detailed account that will appeal to students of Japanese history and railway buffs alike.&lt;/div&gt;" />
