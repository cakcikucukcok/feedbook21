  <title>The Enigma of Clarence Thomas - Corey Robin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Enigma of Clarence Thomas&lt;/i&gt; is a groundbreaking revisionist take on the Supreme Court justice everyone knows about but no one knows.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people can tell you two things about Clarence Thomas: Anita Hill accused him of sexual harassment, and he almost never speaks from the bench. Here are some things they don&#39;t know: Thomas is a black nationalist. In college he memorized the speeches of Malcolm X. He believes white people are incurably racist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first examination of its kind, Corey Robin - one of the foremost analysts of the right - delves deeply into both Thomas&#39;s biography and his jurisprudence, masterfully reading his Supreme Court opinions against the backdrop of his autobiographical and political writings and speeches. The hidden source of Thomas&#39;s conservative views, Robin shows, is a profound skepticism that racism can be overcome. Thomas is convinced that any government action on behalf of African-Americans will be tainted by racism; the most African-Americans can hope for is that white people will get out of their way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s a reason, Robin concludes, why liberals often complain that Thomas doesn&#39;t speak but seldom pay attention when he does. Were they to listen, they&#39;d hear a racial pessimism that often sounds similar to their own. Cutting across the ideological spectrum, this unacknowledged consensus about the impossibility of progress is key to understanding today&#39;s political stalemate.&lt;/p&gt;" />
