  <title>Racism and Hate - Jimmy C. Cameron</title>
      <meta name="description" content="RACISM and HATE: An American Reality, is a provocative new updated examination
of Dr. Gunnar Myrdals epic study of the subject matter done over 70 years ago in the
late 1930s.
That study took a look at where race relations were in the country and the effect it was
having on our democracy, some 70 years after the Civil War.
That work was titled  An American Dilemma: The Negro Problem and Modern Democracy
The author, in this work, looked back at our history here in America, dealing with race
relations, over the last 70 years and through exhausted research and analysis, concluded
that the dilemma was not so much a particular people, but in fact, the dilemma had
more to do with the man induced  self-fulfi lling prophecy of Racism.
To put a human face on the subject matter he used his own familys history here in
Georgia starting in 1784 through slavery, through the Civil War, through the Jim Crow
laws of the South, through Plessey v Ferguson, clear up until 1954 when Brown v Board
of Education overturned Plessey.
The book take a critical look at the year 1954, fi rst analyzing the enormity of the 14th
amendment rights violations that Plessey had allowed to occur and then secondly the
ramifi cations of the Brown v Board of Education case.
The author also examine the lighting rod effect the fi rst American President of African
descent has had on bringing the hidden vestiges of RACISM out of the closet and
placing it front and center on the nations conscience." />
