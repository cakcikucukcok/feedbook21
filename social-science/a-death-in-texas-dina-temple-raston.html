  <title>A Death in Texas - Dina Temple-Raston</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;An extraordinary account of how a small Texas town struggled to come to grips with its racist past in the aftermath of the brutal murder of James Byrd, Jr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On June 7, 1998, a forty-nine-year-old black man named James Byrd, Jr., was chained to the bumper of a truck and dragged three miles down a country road by a trio of young white men. It didn&#39;t take long for the residents of Jasper, Texas, to learn about the murder or to worry that the name of their town would become the nation&#39;s shorthand for hate crimes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the initial investigation through the trials and their aftermath, &lt;i&gt;A Death in Texas &lt;/i&gt;tells the story of the infamous Byrd murder as seen through the eyes of enlightened Sheriff Billy Rowles. What he sees is a community forced to confront not only a grisly crime but also antebellum traditions about race. Drawing on extensive interviews with key players, journalist Dina Temple-Raston introduces a remarkable cast of characters, from the baby-faced killer, Bill King, to Joe Tonahill, Jasper&#39;s white patriarch who can&#39;t understand the furor over the killing. There&#39;s also James Byrd, the hard-drinking victim with his own dark past; the prosecutor and defense attorneys; and Bill King&#39;s father, who is dying of a broken heart as he awaits his son&#39;s execution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as Bernard Lefkowitz pulled back the curtain on Glenridge, New Jersey, in his classic work Our Guys, Temple-Raston goes behind the scenes in Jasper, Texas, to tell the story of a town where racism and evil made itself at home&lt;/p&gt;" />
