  <title>The Beautiful and the Damned - Siddhartha Deb</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A &lt;i&gt;Globe and Mail&lt;/i&gt; Best Books of the Year 2011 Title&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Siddhartha Deb grew up in a remote town in the northeastern hills of India and made his way to the United States via a fellowship at Columbia. Six years after leaving home, he returned as an undercover reporter for &lt;i&gt;The Guardian&lt;/i&gt;, working at a call center in Delhi in 2004, a time when globalization was fast proceeding and Thomas L. Friedman declared the world flat. Deb&#39;s experience interviewing the call-center staff led him to undertake this book and travel throughout the subcontinent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Beautiful and the Damned &lt;/i&gt;examines India&#39;s many contradictions through various individual and extraordinary perspectives. With lyrical and commanding prose, Deb introduces the reader to an unforgettable group of Indians, including a Gatsby-like mogul in Delhi whose hobby is producing big-budget gangster films that no one sees; a wiry, dusty farmer named Gopeti whose village is plagued by suicides and was the epicenter of a riot; and a sad-eyed waitress named Esther who has set aside her dual degrees in biochemistry and botany to serve Coca-Cola to arms dealers at an upscale hotel called Shangri La. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like no other writer, Deb humanizes the post-globalization experience--its advantages, failures, and absurdities. India is a country where you take a nap and someone has stolen your job, where you buy a BMW but still have to idle for cows crossing your path. A personal, narrative work of journalism and cultural analysis in the same vein as Adrian Nicole LeBlanc&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Random Family &lt;/i&gt;and V. S. Naipaul&#39;s India series, &lt;i&gt;The Beautiful and the Damned &lt;/i&gt;is an important and incisive new work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Beautiful and the Damned &lt;/i&gt;is a Publishers Weekly Best Nonfiction title for 2011.&lt;/p&gt;" />
