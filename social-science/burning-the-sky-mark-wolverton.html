  <title>Burning the Sky - Mark Wolverton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;The summer of 1958 was a nerve-racking time. Ever since the  Soviet Union proved that it possessed an operational intercontinental ballistic  missile with the launch of Sputnik, the world watched anxiously as the two  superpowers engaged in a game of nuclear one-upmanship. Tensions escalated  between the United States and the Soviet Union over their respective nuclear  weapons reserves, both sides desperate for a solution to the threat of the  massive, instant destruction the one could cause on the other.In the midst of this rising  tension, Nicholas Christofilos, an eccentric Greek-American physicist, brought  forth an outlandish, albeit ingenious, idea to defend the US from a Soviet  attack: launching atomic bombs from the South Atlantic Ocean, about 1,100 miles  from Cape Town, to detonate in outer space to fry incoming Soviet ICBMs with an  artificial radiation belt. Known as Project Argus, this plan is the biggest,  most secret, and riskiest scientific experiment in history, and classified  details of this operation have been long obscured. In Burning the Sky, Mark Wolverton tells the unknown and controversial  story of this scheme to reveal a fascinating narrative almost completely  forgotten by history--one that still has powerful resonances today. Drawing from recently declassified  sources, Burning the Sky chronicles  Christofilos&#39;s unconventional idea from its inception to execution--when the  so-called mad scientist persuaded the military to carry out the most grandiose  scientific experiment ever conceived, using the entire Earth&#39;s atmosphere as a  laboratory. With over a decade of experience researching and writing about the  sociological and political impacts of the science of the Cold War, Wolverton is  the ideal authority on this risky experiment. Meticulously researched, with the  pacing of a thriller and the language of science fiction, Burning the Sky will intrigue any lover of scientific or military  history and will remind readers why Project Argus remains frighteningly  relevant nearly sixty years later.&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
