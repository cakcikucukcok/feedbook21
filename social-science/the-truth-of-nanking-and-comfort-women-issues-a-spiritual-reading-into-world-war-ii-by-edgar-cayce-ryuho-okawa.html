  <title>The Truth of Nanking and Comfort Women Issues: A Spiritual Reading into World War II by Edgar Cayce - Ryuho Okawa</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Did the so-called &quot;Nanking Massacre&quot; and the military comfort women forcefully taken by the Japanese troops actually exist as historical facts? In this book, we attempt to investigate whether the two events actually took place by using a new method. This is not merely to restore the international honor of Japan. We are hoping to review the causes of World War II, look over the world justice made by the victorious nations after the war and reveal the true world history. &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Searching for the Truth using spiritual method&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; First chapter of the book is a spiritual interview conducted with the guardian spirit of Yoshikazu Sakamoto (1927 - Present), professor emeritus at the University of Tokyo, who also became Japan&#39;s representative of the left wing scholar as a theoretical supporter on masochistic view of history. A guardian spirit is a part of the subconscious of the person living on earth and they are basically unable to lie. &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; The second chapter is a &quot;time travel&quot; reading that goes back more than 70 years into the past, conducted by the spirit of Edgar Cayce (1877 - 1945), a psychic who was known as &quot;The Sleeping Prophet&quot; in the United States. The readings conducted by Edgar Cayce provides the details that would bring no doubts of Nanking city at the time when the large massacre is said to have taken place, the situation of the women who are said to have been military comfort women and the truth behind the anti-Japan propaganda of the United States during and after the war. &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;What is a spiritual message? &amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; The author of this book, Master Ryuho Okawa of Happy Science, uses his spiritual power that exceeds the highest level in the history of humankind to summon the guardian spirits of living people as well as the spirits who lived in the past residing in the spirit world. Depending on their level of recognition, some spirits can give a spiritual message in Japanese using Master&#39;s language center even if the spirit is not of Japanese origin. &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; The spiritual messages of more than 200 spirits of prominent figures have been recorded by Master Okawa since 2010, and the majority of these have been published. In recent years, there have been spiritual messages recorded in English, and English translations are being done on the spiritual messages given in Japanese. &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Why spiritual messages are a must for the human race&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; There are two main reasons why Master Okawa is conducting and publishing countless spiritual messages at an amazing pace. One is to provide the supplies mankind needs in order to think about the future. The path that humans should take can be searched for by revealing true history from, and judging the content of the ideas of, the spirits of past religious leaders, politicians, scientists and so on. In addition, by disclosing the true thoughts and feelings of leading figures who are alive, we can foresee the direction that international politics and economy are proceeding in, and detect and warn of the crises. &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; The other reason is to prove the existence of the spirit world. Great sages of mankind such as Shakyamuni Buddha, Socrates, Jesus Christ, Muhammad and Newton all recognized the existence of spirits and the spirit world in which God and Buddha reside. A global movement to believe in the spirit world is occurring now through spiritualism, near-death experiences, etc. The spiritual messages series conducted by Master Okawa is making the most thorough attempt at proving the existence of the spirit world. &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; We hope that you, too, will read the spiritual messages series by Happy Science and find out the truth in history, what is at the depths of the current world affairs, and how the human race shou" />
