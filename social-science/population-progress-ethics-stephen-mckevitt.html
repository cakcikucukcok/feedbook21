  <title>Population, Progress, Ethics - Stephen McKevitt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Population, Progress, Ethics addresses a number of critical problems America currently faces. First, and most importantly, this book tackles the huge issue of human overpopulation, a crisis now affecting everyone on our planet. The worlds human population has tripled in the authors lifetime, to more than 7.5 billion, creating significant challenges around the globe. 
The book next examines the changing conditions that our present-day environmental difficulties are posing to society. More broadly, the author reviews the current economic and social troubles currently ailing the United States, but not in a strict economics textbook manner. His book posits that the routine rhetoric and stance of those on both the left and the right of the political spectrum are often reflexes, and of limited usefulness in the face of the grave issues facing the nation and the rest of the globe.
On a positive note, Stephen McKevitt crafts a reasoned, passionate argument for communities and professionals to unite in solving these problems. The author comes up with a to-do list for his readers, offering a number of possible and reasonable steps that the citizens of our nation can take to better the lives of us all, and the rest of the world, too, as we head into the future." />
