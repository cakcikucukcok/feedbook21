  <title>Why Terrorism Continues in the Philippines? - Mr. Ano Who</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book talks about the cause of continues terrorism in the Philippines. Some biblical research reveals that the Greed or the love of money and power are the root cause of all evil desire as mentioned in the Holy Scripture, the Bible. Findings also show that Illiteracy, less education made people short sighted in life and narrow mindedness prone to terrorism and rebellious ideology. While this book reveals huge amount of Military Assistance to the Philippines from different countries, particularly from the United States and other nations, it turned the government officials and military corrupt. The US Military Aid leads to dependence and corruption in the government or military that seem to fan the fire of terrorism rather than ending it. GAOs recommendation requires government accountability and comprehensive policy to make sure Anti-terrorism funds will be used as intended. It explores that the war of terror is not going to be won with bombs and weapons, but through Literacy, education, and economic development programs win the hearts and minds of the people subdued by terroristic ideology." />
