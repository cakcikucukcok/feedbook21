      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; 	A proliferation of press headlines, social science texts and &quot;ethical&quot; concerns about the social implications of recent developments in human genetics and biomedicine have created a sense that, at least in European and American contexts, both the way we treat the human body and our attitudes towards it have changed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; 	This volume asks what really happens to social relations in the face of new types of transaction &amp;ndash; such as organ donation, forensic identification and other new medical and reproductive technologies - that involve the use of corporeal material.
