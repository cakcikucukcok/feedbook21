  <title>The Mystery of Samba - Hermano Vianna</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Samba is Brazil&#39;s &quot;national rhythm,&quot; the foremost symbol of its culture and nationhood. To the outsider, samba and the famous pre-Lenten carnival of which it is the centerpiece seem to showcase the country&#39;s African heritage. Within Brazil, however, samba symbolizes the racial and cultural mixture that, since the 1930s, most Brazilians have come to believe defines their unique national identity. &lt;br/&gt;But how did Brazil become &quot;the Kingdom of Samba&quot; only a few decades after abolishing slavery in 1888? Typically, samba is represented as having changed spontaneously, mysteriously, from a &quot;repressed&quot; music of the marginal and impoverished to a national symbol cherished by all Brazilians. Here, however, Hermano Vianna shows that the nationalization of samba actually rested on a long history of relations between different social groups--poor and rich, weak and powerful--often working at cross-purposes to one another. &lt;br/&gt;A fascinating exploration of the &quot;invention of tradition,&quot; &lt;i&gt;The Mystery of Samba&lt;/i&gt; is an excellent introduction to Brazil&#39;s ongoing conversation on race, popular culture, and national identity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />

Samba is Brazil's "national rhythm," the foremost symbol of its culture and nationhood. To the outsider, samba and the famous pre-Lenten carnival of which it is the centerpiece seem to showcase the country's African heritage.<br /><b><i>Mystery of Samba by Hermano Vianna - Goodreads</i></b> | The "mystery" of the title is samba's transformation "from infamous outcast to (virtually official) national emblem." Brazilian anthropologist Vianna here casts a dry postmodern eye on issues of cultural invention and the identification of "authentic" folk idioms for political and commercial purposes.<br /><b><i>The Mystery of Samba : Popular Music and National Identity ...</i></b> | The Mystery of Samba points to the Brazilian nation's strong expression of popular culture as a long term transcultural experience between cultural elites and popular voices both inside and outside Brazil. . . . This masterful work is a very current and major contribution to the debate about culture across the social sciences and the humanities.—Nelson H.
