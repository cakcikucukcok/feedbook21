  <title>Turfloop a Conscious Pariah - Chris Kanyane Kanyane</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book provides reflections on the butterfly effect on how Turfloop brought in the Age of Barack Obama. What is the Age of Barack Obama? &lt;p&gt;
To paraphrase Dr Ineke Van Kessel, a prominent historian at the Leiden University in the Netherlands: &lt;p&gt;
The University of the North also known as Turfloop, played a vital role as the center of communication, coordination, ideological direction... the engine of bringing the new South Africa was University of the North &lt;p&gt;
We approached this book like detectives. Fortunately in our detective work, we were not concerned with a particular agenda; we were not trying to prove that a certain method of thinking was right or wrong. We didnt want this book to be filled with personal opinions and biases. We wanted this book to be juice and accessible to every person who reads it in whatever corner of the world. We have to back up our story with facts, of course, and get other people to do practical analysis and later, we added our own perspectives.  &lt;p&gt;
When we completed writing this book, we passed it around amongst critical people spread across the globe. Most of them said that the book is somehow highbrow and, at the same time all together lowbrow, which came as a compliment. A lot of people are somewhere in between. We want this book to embody that, because there are many people there we want them to appreciate this book." />
