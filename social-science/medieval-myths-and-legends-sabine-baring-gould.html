  <title>Medieval Myths and Legends - Sabine Baring-Gould</title>
      <meta name="description" content="FROM the earliest ages of the Church, the advent of the Man of Sin has been looked forward to with terror, and the passages of Scripture relating to him have been studied with solemn awe, lest that day of wrath should come upon the Church unawares. As events in the world&amp;rsquo;s history took place which seemed to be indications of the approach of Antichrist, a great horror fell upon men&amp;rsquo;s minds, and their imaginations conjured up myths which flew from mouth to mouth, and which were implicitly believed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Before speaking of these strange tales which produced such an effect on the minds of men in the middle ages, it will be well briefly to examine the opinions of divines of the early ages on the passages of Scripture connected with the coming of the last great persecutor of the Church. Antichrist was believed by most ancient writers to be destined to arise out of the tribe of Dan, a belief founded on the prediction of Jacob, &amp;ldquo;Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path&amp;rdquo; (conf. Jeremiah viii. 16), and on the exclamation of the dying patriarch, when looking on his son Dan, &amp;ldquo;I have waited for Thy Salvation, O Lord,&amp;rdquo; as though the long-suffering of God had borne long with that tribe, but in vain, and it was to be extinguished without hope. This, indeed, is implied in the sealing of the servants of God in their foreheads (Revelation vii.), when twelve thousand out of every tribe, except Dan, were seen by St. John to receive the seal of adoption, whilst of the tribe of Dan not one was sealed, as though it, to a man, had apostatized." />

Baring-Gould is expert at tracing the roots of the various stories and legends. He then carries the stories forward and shows how the root story can become a basis for related myths across cultures and countries.<br /><b><i>Curious Myths of the Middle Ages: Baring-Gould, Sabine ...</i></b> | In this 1862 book Baring-Gould dissects twelve legends which were widely current in the Middle Ages, comparing the strangely similar forms collected from areas as far apart as India and Finland, and shows that the same myths reurn again and again, perhaps over two thousand years, albeit with different details, names and places but the same roots.<br /><b><i>Curious Myths of the Middle Ages: Gould, Sabine Baring ...</i></b> | Sabine Baring-Gould was born in the parish of St Sidwell, Exeter.
