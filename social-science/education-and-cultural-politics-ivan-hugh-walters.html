  <title>Education and Cultural Politics - ivan hugh walters</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Education and Cultural Politics: Interrogating Idiotic Education is a conceptualization of protest and resistance against the cultural politics of oppression and domination of people of African descent in the Caribbean and North America.  It is also a theorization of their redemption from being victims of racism, classism, sexism, and heterosexism. The book combines the theoretical models of discrimination and oppression through the use of the axis of the social evils to critically analyze the cultural politics of education in relation to black people in the African Diaspora.  It does this through the lens of critical redemptive education which is seen through an Afrocentric philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book illustrates how the lives of black people are constructed by slavery and colonialism which have etched their mores into the black psyche. The book advocates the view that slavocracy, the colonial construction of black psyche, is not indelible.  It can be deconstructed through conscience and reconstructed through a non-idiotic, liberatory education using the philosophy of critical redemptive education which fosters a genuine koinonia among black communities serving as the antidote for the current black nihilism in black communities which is the legacy of our oppressive existence.&lt;/p&gt;" />
