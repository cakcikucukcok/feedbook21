  <title>Instrument Procedures Handbook: ASA FAA-H-8083-16B - Federal Aviation Administration (Faa)/Aviation Supplies &amp; Academics (Asa)</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Instrument Procedures Handbook is a technical reference manual for professional pilots who operate under instrument flight rules (IFR). It provides real-world guidance on how instrument-rated pilots can best use the system they&#39;ve trained for, as well as in-depth coverage of instrument charts and procedures for IFR takeoff, departure, en route, arrival, approach, and landing.
For every navigation receiver and phase of flight, this handbook details the required precision that is needed to stay within protected airspace and make a successful approach. Safety information for relevant subjects such as runway incursion, land hand hold short operations, controlled flight into terrain, and human factors issues are covered here. the emphasis is on airplane operations, but the book also contains a chapter dedicated to helicopter instrument procedures.
The Instrument Procedures Handbook expands on the FAA&#39;s Instrument Flying Handbook (FAA-H-8083-15). This handbook introduces advanced information for IFR operations. Airline Transport Pilots (ATP), Instrument pilots, Instrument Flight Instructors (CFIIs), and students preparing for the instrument rating will find this a valuable resource in studying for the FAA Knowledge Exams and getting ready for their checkrides. Illustrated throughout with detailed, full-color drawings and photographs; also includes acronyms list, glossary and index.
Last updated in 2015, this 2017 edition includes editorial wording changes for clarity and consistency, updated terminology to reflect current rules and procedures, while updated graphics and illustrations improve the appearance, readability and understanding. In-depth sections on instrument charts and procedures cover all phases of flight from takeoff to landing. Each topic covered is well-detailed and explained in user-friendly terms." />
