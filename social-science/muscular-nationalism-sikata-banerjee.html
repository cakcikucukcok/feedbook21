  <title>Muscular Nationalism - Sikata Banerjee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A particular dark triumph of modern nationalism has been its ability to persuade citizens to sacrifice their lives for a political vision forged by emotional ties to a common identity.&amp;nbsp;Both men and women can respond to nationalistic calls to fight that portray muscular warriors defending their nation against an easily recognizable enemy. This &amp;#8220;us versus them&amp;#8221; mentality can be seen in sectarian violence between Hindus and Muslims, Tamils and Sinhalas, Serbs and Kosovars, and Protestants and Catholics. In&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;Muscular Nationalism&lt;/em&gt;, Sikata Banerjee takes a comparative look at&amp;nbsp;India&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;Ireland&amp;nbsp;and the relationship among gender, violence, and nationalism. Exploring key texts and events from 1914-2004, Banerjee explores how women negotiate &amp;#8220;muscular nationalisms&amp;#8221; as they seek to be recognized as legitimate nationalists and equal stakeholders in their national struggles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banerjee argues that the gendered manner in which dominant nationalism has been imagined in most states in the world has had important implications for women&amp;#8217;s lived experiences.&amp;nbsp;Drawing on a specific intersection of gender and nationalism, she discusses the manner in which women negotiate a political and social terrain infused with a masculinized dream of nation-building.&amp;nbsp;India and Ireland&amp;#8212;two states shaped by the legacy of British imperialism and forced to deal with modern political/social conflict centering on competing nationalisms&amp;#8212;provide two provocative case studies that illuminate the complex interaction between gender and nation.&lt;/p&gt;" />
