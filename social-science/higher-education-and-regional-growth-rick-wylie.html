  <title>Higher Education and Regional Growth - Rick Wylie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;ul style=&quot;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;&quot;&gt;&lt;li value=&quot;800&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The specialisation, knowledge and innovation brought about by universities often play a key role for the economic success of cities and regions. Yet higher education is also increasingly regarded, in some European countries and regions, as an economic sector in itself, whereby the measure of success lies in the ability to attract international students and set up international partnerships. Universities need therefore to find successful strategies responding to global challenges and fitting local contexts. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This edited volume brings together a collection of international and regional experts on the subject of higher education and regional growth. It explores the changing role of universities in a globally competitive environment and the way in which they interact with the regional business and policy community. The publication builds upon a seminar co-organised by Policy Network and the UCLan Applied Policy Science Unit which was funded by the Samuel Lindow Foundation, which took place at the University of Central Lancashire (UCLan) on 12 December 2014. It brings together the wide array of evidence presented at the event and provides the reader with additional input from academic experts. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
