  <title>The Mirage of Dignity on the Highways of Human ‘Progress’ - Lukman Harees</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Modern Man is hypocritically boasting of  unprecedented material progress in a world , where ,inter-alia millions daily go to bed hungry, die or get killed through unwanted wars and preventable causes, live in inhumane conditions , vulnerable being exploited , with ever widening inequality , and might still ruling over right in international relations, even in the post UDHR era! an indictment on the collective conscience of mankind.  Besides, the flame of materialism has been devouring time tested moral values, causing chaos within the basic unit in society- the family and  relegating Man and his dignity to the level of  animals and even manipulating his identity.
Therefore questions arise: Is Moral law fading ; are political/economic systems and institutions like UN failing in realizing the lofty goal of  affording due dignity , basic rights and social justice humanity deserves? Can  the bystanders be mere onlookers anymore? This book seeks to dispassionately survey the yawning gap between the rhetoric and the ground reality in bringing about dignity  and social justice for humanity from bystanders perspective in the light of these questions and underlines the imperative need for moral progress to go hand in hand to make Man assume his due role as the trustee on earth. It also exhorts bystanders to close ranks as  human- dignity champions, rights defenders, identity protectors-  against onslaughts  from power hungry politicians, mighty powers and vested interests. This is the need of the times and what our future progeny demands." />
