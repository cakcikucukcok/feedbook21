  <title>Positively Fifth Street - James McManus</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rough sex, black magic, murder, and the science-and eros-of gambling meet in the ultimate book about Las Vegas&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;James McManus was sent to Las Vegas by &lt;i&gt;Harper&lt;/i&gt;&#39;s  to cover the World Series of Poker in 2000, especially the mushrooming  progress of women in the $23 million event, and the murder of Ted  Binion, the tournament&#39;s prodigal host, purportedly done in by a  stripper and her boyfriend with a technique so outré it took a Manhattan  pathologist to identify it. Whether a jury would convict the attractive  young couple was another story altogether.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;McManus risks his entire &lt;i&gt;Harper&lt;/i&gt;&#39;s  advance in a long-shot attempt to play in the tournament himself. Only  with actual table experience, he tells his skeptical wife, can he  capture the hair-raising brand of poker that determines the world  champion. The heart of the book is his deliciously suspenseful account  of the tournament itself-the players, the hand-to-hand combat, and his  own unlikely progress in it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Written in the tradition of &lt;i&gt;The Gambler &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;The Biggest Game in Town, Positively Fifth Street&lt;/i&gt;  is a high-stakes adventure, a penetrating study of America&#39;s card game,  and a terrifying but often hilarious account of one man&#39;s effort to  understand what Edward O. Wilson has called &quot;Pleistocene exigencies&quot;-the  eros and logistics of our primary competitive instincts.&lt;/p&gt;" />
