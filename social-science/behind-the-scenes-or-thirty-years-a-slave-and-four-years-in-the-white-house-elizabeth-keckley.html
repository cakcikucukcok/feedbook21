  <title>Behind the Scenes, or, Thirty Years a Slave, and Four Years in the White House - Elizabeth Keckley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;Behind the Scenes&lt;/i&gt; is the life story of Elizabeth Keckley, a shrewd entrepreneur who, while enslaved, raised enough money to purchase freedom for herself and her son. Keckley moved to Washington, D.C., where she worked as a seamstress and dressmaker for the wives of influential politicians. She eventually became a close confidante of Mary Todd Lincoln. Several years after President Lincoln&#39;s assassination, when Mrs. Lincoln&#39;s financial situation had worsened, Keckley helped organize an auction of the former first lady&#39;s dresses, eliciting strong criticism from members of the Washington elite. &lt;i&gt;Behind the Scenes&lt;/i&gt; is, therefore, both a slave narrative and Keckley&#39;s attempt to defend the motives behind the auction. However, the book&#39;s publication prompted an even greater public outcry, with the added racial subtext of white society&#39;s disdain for Keckley&#39;s audacity in publishing details of the Lincolns&#39; private lives. Keckley&#39;s dressmaking business failed, the Lincoln family cut all ties with her, and she lived out her final days in a home for the indigent. Scholars have acknowledged the book&#39;s valuable account of slave life as well as its intimate view into the Lincoln White House. Biographers of the Lincolns have quoted extensively from Keckley&#39;s text.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A DOCSOUTH BOOK. This collaboration between UNC Press and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Library brings classic works back into print.
