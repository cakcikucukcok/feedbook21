  <title>The Oxford Handbook of Ethics of War - Seth Lazar, Helen Frowe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Recent years have seen a resurgence of interest, among both philosophers, legal scholars, and military experts, on the ethics of war.  Due in part due to post 9/11 events, this resurgence is also due to a growing theoretical sophistication among scholars in this area.  Recently there has been very influential work published on the justificaton of killing in self-defense and war, and the topic of the ethics of war is now more important than ever as a discrete field.
The 28 commissioned chapters in this Handbook will present a comprehensive overview of the field as well as make significant and novel contributions, and collectively they will set the terms of the debate for the next decade.  Lazar and Frowe will invite the leading scholars in the field to write on topics that are new to them, making the volume a compilation of fresh ideas rather than a rehash of earlier work.  The volume will be dicided into five sections: Method, History, Resort, Conduct, and Aftermath.  The contributors will be a mix of junior and senior figures, and will include well known scholars like Michael Walzer, Jeff McMahan, and David Rodin." />
