  <title>Grappling with Change in Africa - Emmanuel Danstan Chinunda</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book brings revolution to the African continent. It makes it clear that for Africans to advance in life they require a different approach to life. The book uses proverbs and wise sayings from Africa to enhance the notion that Africa as a continent appreciates issues about change and other players from outside the continent get a buy-in into change management.  It is now generally accepted that from Cape to Cairo one sees a continent pregnant with resources but it is classified as the poorest by bank balance. The book uses African wisdom to help readers around the world to appreciate the African transformation. Change is always hardest at the beginning but it gets easier and better as days transform into years. Nothing in life changes without change. The book suggests ways of how Africa can swing the pendulum and rise to be a global shining star by owning and using its natural resources wisely and embracing transformational leadership. This would rewrite the economic order and turn the richest poor continent into a super rich continent." />
