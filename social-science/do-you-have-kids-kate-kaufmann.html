  <title>Do You Have Kids? - Kate Kaufmann</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Weaving together stories from non-moms aged thirty-seven to ninety-one, a growing body of research, and the author’s own story, &lt;em&gt;Do You Have Kids?&lt;/em&gt; probes the non-mom&#39;s entire adulthood—from the morphing meaning of family to what she leaves behind when she dies. 
&lt;br&gt;
Today about one in five American women will never have children, whether by choice or by destiny. Yet few women talk much about what not having kids means to their lives and identities. Not that they don’t want to; there just aren’t obvious catalysts for such open conversations. In fact, social taboos preclude exploration of the topic—and since our family-centric culture doesn’t know quite what to do with non-parents, there’s potential for childless and childfree women to be sidelined, ignored, or drowned out. Yet there’s widespread, pent-up demand for understanding and validating this perfectly normal way of being. In this straight-shooting, exhaustively researched book, women without kids talk candidly about the ways in which their lives deviate from societal norms and expectations&quot; here, instead of at end of sentence—the good, the bad, and the unapparent—in which their lives deviate from societal norms and expectations." />
