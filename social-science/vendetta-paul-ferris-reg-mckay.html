  <title>Vendetta - Paul Ferris, Reg McKay</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The armed guards and Alsatians stayed put as the prison gates slammed shut. &#39;I&#39;m going straight,&#39; Paul Ferris announced to the press, then sped off in a waiting car. Before he&#39;d reached the first corner, the journalists were after him. And they weren&#39;t the only ones . . . Paul Ferris ruled crime in Scotland. He had links to London firms, Manchester gangs and Liverpool faces. He&#39;d been accused of murdering The Godfather&#39;s son, Fatboy, and found not guilty. Some cops talked of killing him. Now he was telling the world that he was walking away from his life of crime. But would they let him? Vendetta tells the astonishing inside story of what happened next to Paul Ferris. And it&#39;s a story of international gangsters, hit contracts, murders, bank scams, Essex-boy torturers, corrupt politics, crackhead hitmen, knife duels, terrorists and more. In Vendetta, Paul Ferris slashes open the underbelly of Britain&#39;s streets and exposes the dark forces that police them as well as revealing the truth about what really happened to him and about the conspiracies and corruption that won&#39;t leave him alone. For years, new enemies and old foes have tried to silence Paul Ferris. But it&#39;s Ferris who&#39;s here to tell the tale while many of them are not. And some tale it is." />
