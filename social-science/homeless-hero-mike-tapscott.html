Tapscott&#39;s book explores humanity in a way that is vibrantly vivid and personally accessible to the reader. Many questions that we have probably asked ourselves at one time or another are addressed: what is homelessness, why does it exist, are they just on drugs, how do I help, when is helping really enabling, and why does it bother me so much in the first place? Here is a compilation of experiences from Tapscott&#39;s experimental journey into life on the streets, his own volunteer work, and his fascinating interviews with individuals utilizing and individuals working for the social service system. Homeless Hero is a case study, an experiment, an adventure, and a multi-layered examination of American society that seeks to help you expand your understanding of homelessness and more importantly your own humanity.&lt;/p&gt;" />
