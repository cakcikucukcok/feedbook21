  <title>Forgotten Citizens: Deportation, Children, and the Making of American Exiles and Orphans - Luis Zayas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The United States Constitution insures that  all persons born in the US are citizens with equal protection under the law.  But in todays America, the US-born children of undocumented immigrants--over four million of them--do not enjoy fully the benefits of citizenship or of feeling that they belong.  Children in mixed-status families are forgotten in the loud and discordant immigration debate.  They live under the constant threat that  their parents will suddenly be deported.  Their parents face impossible decisions: make their children exiles or make them orphans.     In Forgotten Citizens, Luis Zayas holds a mirror to a nation in crisis, providing invaluable perspectives for anyone brave enough to look. Zayas draws on his extensive work as a mental health clinician and researcher to present the most complete picture yet of how immigration policy subverts childrens rights, harms their mental health, and leaves lasting psychological trauma.  We meet Virginia, a kindergartener so terrified of revealing her familys status that she took her fathers warning dont say anything so literally she hadnt spoken in school in over a year.  We hear from Brandon, exiled with his family to Mexico, who worries that his father will die in the desert trying to immigrate again.    Children like Virginia and Brandon have been silenced and their stories largely overlooked in the broader debates about immigration policy. As this book demonstrates, we can no longer afford to ignore them." />
