  <title>Co-Ed Found Cheating: Sara Makes Tina Serve As Her Personal Slave Girl Volume 2 - Candy Kross</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The girls have now arrived home and Sara informed Tina to take a shower and clean up because they were going out tonight to ladies night out. Tina was sticky from her pussy juices and welcomed the shower and break from Sara.    The girls got ready and it was time to go out. &quot;You&#39;re not going to make me wear the leash tonight, are you?&quot; Tina asked nervously.    &quot;No, we&#39;re just going to go out and have some fun tonight.&quot; Sara smiled and winked at her.    Both girls were dressed in skimpy little mini skirts and tight half tops. They both knew they looked hot and were ready to go out. They left for the club in a taxi, because they knew they were gong to be drinking.    Sara and Tina arrived at the nightclub. For it being Ladies Night, where women could get in free, there were a lot of college guys in the club. A lot more college guys than girls. The girls walked over to the bar and ordered their drinks.    They had a few drinks and began relaxing." />
