  <title>Flim Flam Man - Jim Pugh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Flim Flam Man is composed of political columns written for two Northern California newspapers, the Vallejo Times Herald and the Benicia Herald, between 2009 and 2013. 
These columns strongly reflected the adamantly conservative political views of writer Jim Pugh. The columns were, without a doubt, highly controversial for the most part, yet the reader will surely find them interesting even though he or she may not always agree with the writer&#39;s view points.
During these five years in America, this country was made to endure perhaps the most incom- petent chief executive ever to sit in the White House. This same president however, was af- forded nearly complete support by the American press and media as a whole. It was on this phenomena that the writer concentrates a great deal of his attention during this period.
The readers certainly realized that Mr. Pugh was no fan of President Obama, but it was very clear that he certainly presented a fair and honest report of the actions of this president dur- ing the five year period.
Read and enjoy, for certainly even though you just might be a supporter of the president, you will find it very hard to put down.
Boring it is not." />
