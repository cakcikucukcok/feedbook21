  <title>Smoke, Mirrors, and Chains - Larry Kenneth Alexander</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Blacks born in colonial America were Englishmen with an inalienable right to liberty under Britain&#39;s rule of law and those who purported to be slavemasters were criminals. The product of graft -slavery was America&#39;s first continuing criminal enterprise. However, with Lord Chief Justice Mansfield&#39;s utterance in 1772, &quot;...Let justice be done although the heavens fall...&quot; - a freedom trial of a slave named James Somerset and then Britain highest court&#39;s declaration that slavery was unconstitutional, America&#39;s thirteen colonies exploded into rebellion. Myths developed to shield the founding generation and were used to further nationalist chauvinism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1779, Britain repudiated colonial lawlessness and in committing itself to the restoration of the rule of law tradition - unconditionally freed all black slaves. And &quot;...most strictly forbid any Person to sell or claim Right over any NEGROE (sic)...&quot; Four years later, the U.S. sued for peace and by treaty agreed to &quot;set at liberty&quot; all British subjects; but reneged and relegated 500,000 black British subjects into slavery. The U.S. exploited legally free British subjects - in derogation of international law. The slavery narrative has overthrown U.S. history and racial chauvinism is nothing more than victim-blaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The significance of the Somerset decision - America&#39;first emancipation of slaves has escaped telling. Told with all the power and drama of a novel, Smoke, Mirrors, and Chains: America&#39;s First Continuing Criminal Enterprise is an extraordinary account of pulse-pounding human drama defined by criminal enslavement, political intrigue and raw human achievement.&lt;br /&gt;
