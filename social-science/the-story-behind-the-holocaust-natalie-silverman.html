  <title>The Story Behind the Holocaust - Natalie Silverman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What do we know about the Vatican Military Orders, the Johanniters, Freemasons, or other secret societies like the Bilderberg Group or the Trilateral Commission?  What is the connection between these and other secret groups, World Wars, Globalization and International Free Trade Agreements of today?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During World War 2, which European Royal Families (our Allies) sent their families to safety in Canada and then surrendered their nations to the enemy after 1, 2, or 3 days of minimal or no fighting?  Which highly respected North Americans and European Allies supported the enemy with money, oil and gas, patents, military equipment, etc., and why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hitler and &quot;his Handlers&quot; wanted a New World Order (One World Government and One World Religion).  These evil beings believed their victims &quot;unworthy of life&quot; and not only killed and enslaved peoples for religious and racial reasons, but, they satisfied their need for power and control by stealing the assets of their individual victims and of resource rich under-developed nations.   Why do Germany and the Vatican (which has never had an independent audit) have so much gold today when they had so little before WW2?&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Read and Think.  If too unbelievable, do the research.    Truth is stranger than fiction!&lt;/p&gt;" />
