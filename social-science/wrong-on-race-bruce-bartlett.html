  <title>Wrong on Race - Bruce Bartlett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Wrong on Race&lt;/i&gt;, Bruce Bartlett sets the record straight on a hidden past that many Democrats would rather see swept under the carpet. Ranging from the founding of the Republic through to today, it rectifies the unfair perceptions of America&#39;s two national parties. While Nixon&#39;s infamous &quot;Southern Strategy&quot; is constantly referenced in the media, less well remembered are Woodrow Wilson&#39;s segregation of the entire Federal civil service; FDR&#39;s appointment of a member of the KKK to the Supreme Court; John F. Kennedy&#39;s apathy towards civil rights legislation;  and the ascension of Robert Byrd, who is current President pro tempore of the Senate, third in line in the presidential line of succession, and a former member of the KKK. &lt;br&gt;For the last seventy years, African Americans have voted en masse for one party, with little in the end to show for it. Is it time for the pendulum to swing the other way? With the Republican Party furiously engaged in pre-2008 soul searching, this exhaustively researched, incisively written exposé will be an important and compelling component of that debate as we head towards November.&lt;/p&gt;" />
