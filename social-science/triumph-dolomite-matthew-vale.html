  <title>Triumph Dolomite - Matthew Vale</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A model-by-model history of the popular Triumph Dolomite family, the range of quality sporting saloons that started with the Triumph 1300 and was in production from 1965-80. The Triumph 1300 was innovative, with front-wheel drive and a four-door body designed by Giovanni Michelotti. In 1970 the Triumph 1500 and the three-door Toledo were introduced, followed by the range-topping Dolomite in 1972, with Triumph&#39;s slant-4 overhead cam engine and rear-wheel drive. The fast Dolomite Sprint confirmed Triumph&#39;s position as the British &#39;BMW Beater&#39; in 1973, with its powerful 16-valve engine and value achieved through clever engineering. In 1976 the whole range was renamed &#39;Dolomite&#39; - and was a well-rounded model spread of four-door saloons, with engine sizes from 1300cc to 2 litres. With technical specifications and over 150 colour photographs, Triumph Dolomite - An Enthusiast&#39;s Guide also includes competition history, the Dolomites&#39; ancestors, and a guide to buying and owning these iconic saloons. Fully illustrated with 161 colour photographs." />
