  <title>Renaissance in Japan: A Cultural Survey of the Seventeenth Century - Kenneth P. Kirkwood, Arnold J. Toynbee</title>

In these years of the early Tokugawa era, the old aristocratic culture was confronted with the new plebeian awakening, giving rise to dynamic social developments, in effect a peaceful revolution.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The humanistic movement that emerged during this period is epitomized in and popular arts and letters by such famous figures as Basho, the pilgrim poet; Saikaku, novelist of the gilded age, and Chikamatsu, Japan&#39;s greatest playwright.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In that stirring period Basho wrote such undying poetry as: &quot;The lark sings through the long spring day, but never enough for its heart&#39;s content.&quot;  Saikaku noted that &quot;love is darkness, but in the land of love the darkest night is bright as noon.&quot; Chikamatsu wrote wisely that &quot;art is something which lies in the slender margin between the real and the unreal.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In Japan it was the beginning of the end of the feudal Dark Ages&amp;#151;even though the political ramifications would not be manifest until the advent of the Meiji Restoration.&lt;/div&gt;" />
