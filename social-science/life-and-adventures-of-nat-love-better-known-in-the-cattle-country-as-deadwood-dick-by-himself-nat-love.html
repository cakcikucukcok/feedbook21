  <title>Life and Adventures of Nat Love, Better Known in the Cattle Country as &quot;Deadwood Dick,&quot; by Himself - Nat Love</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Nat Love&#39;s memoir &lt;i&gt;Life and Adventures of Nat Love&lt;/i&gt; is one of the only firsthand accounts of an African American cowhand in the western United States from this period. Love and his parents were owned by planter Robert Love, and after Emancipation, his parents remained on Love&#39;s plantation as sharecroppers while Nat left and headed west. He found work as a cowboy, first on the Duval Ranch in the Texas panhandle, then on the Gallinger Ranch in southern Arizona. Love&#39;s narrative details his many adventures and exploits, such as being captured and shot by Pima Indians, who eventually spared his life because they sympathized with his plight as a black man. In Deadwood, Dakota Territory, he entered a rodeo, winning $200 and the nickname Deadwood Dick, a reference to a literary character from a dime novel of the day. Published in 1907, the &lt;i&gt;Life and Adventures of Nat Love&lt;/i&gt; would help to make Love a black folk hero of the Old West.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A DOCSOUTH BOOK.
