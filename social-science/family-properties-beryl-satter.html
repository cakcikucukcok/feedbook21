  <title>Family Properties - Beryl Satter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Part family story and part urban history, a landmark investigation of segregation and urban decay in Chicago -- and cities across the nation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &quot;promised land&quot; for thousands of Southern blacks, postwar Chicago quickly became the most segregated city in the North, the site of the nation&#39;s worst ghettos and the target of Martin Luther King Jr.&#39;s first campaign beyond the South. In this powerful book, Beryl Satter identifies the true causes of the city&#39;s black slums and the ruin of urban neighborhoods throughout the country: not, as some have argued, black pathology, the culture of poverty, or white flight, but a widespread and institutionalized system of legal and financial exploitation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Satter&#39;s riveting account of a city in crisis, unscrupulous lawyers, slumlords, and speculators are pitched against religious reformers, community organizers, and an impassioned attorney who launched a crusade against the profiteers--the author&#39;s father, Mark J. Satter. At the heart of the struggle stand the black migrants who, having left the South with its legacy of sharecropping, suddenly find themselves caught in a new kind of debt peonage. Satter shows the interlocking forces at work in their oppression: the discriminatory practices of the banking industry; the federal policies that created the country&#39;s shameful &quot;dual housing market&quot;; the economic anxieties that fueled white violence; and the tempting profits to be made by preying on the city&#39;s most vulnerable population. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Family Properties: Race, Real Estate, and the Exploitation of Black Urban America&lt;/i&gt; is a monumental work of history, this tale of racism and real estate, politics and finance, will forever change our understanding of the forces that transformed urban America. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Gripping . . . This painstaking portrayal of the human costs of financial racism is the most important book yet written on the black freedom struggle in the urban North.&quot;--David Garrow, &lt;i&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
