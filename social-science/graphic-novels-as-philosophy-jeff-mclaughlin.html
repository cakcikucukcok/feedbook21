  <title>Graphic Novels as Philosophy - Jeff McLaughlin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;br&gt;Contributions by Eric Bain-Selbo, Jeremy Barris, Maria Botero, Manuel &quot;Mandel&quot; Cabrera Jr., David J. Leichter, Ian MacRae, Alfonso Munoz-Corcuera, Corry Shores, and Jarkko S. Tuusvuori&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a follow-up to &lt;i&gt;Comics as Philosophy&lt;/i&gt;, international contributors address two questions: Which philosophical insights, concepts, and tools can shed light on the graphic novel? And how can the graphic novel cast light on the concerns of philosophy? Each contributor ponders a well-known graphic novel to illuminate ways in which philosophy can untangle particular combinations of image and written word for deeper understanding.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jeff McLaughlin collects a range of essays to examine notable graphic novels within the framework posited by these two questions. One essay discusses how a philosopher discovered that the panels in Jeff Lemire&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Essex County&lt;/i&gt; do not just replicate a philosophical argument, but they actually give evidence to an argument that could not have existed otherwise. Another essay reveals how Chris Ware&#39;s manipulation of the medium demonstrates an important sense of time and experience. Still another describes why &lt;i&gt;Maus&lt;/i&gt; tends to be more profound than later works that address the Holocaust because of, not in spite of, the fact that the characters are cartoon animals rather than human.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Other works contemplated include Will Eisner&#39;s &lt;i&gt;A Contract with God&lt;/i&gt;, Alan Moore and David Lloyd&#39;s &lt;i&gt;V for Vendetta&lt;/i&gt;, Alison Bechdel&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Fun Home&lt;/i&gt;, and Joe Sacco&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Footnotes in Gaza&lt;/i&gt;. Mainly, each essay, contributor, graphic novelist, and artist are all doing the same thing: trying to tell us how the world is--at least from their point of view.&lt;/br&gt;" />
