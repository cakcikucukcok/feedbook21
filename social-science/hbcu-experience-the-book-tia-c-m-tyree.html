  <title>Hbcu Experience - the Book - Tia C. M. Tyree</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Co-edited by Historically Black College and University (HBCU) alumni Dr. Tia Tyree and Christopher D. Cathcart, HBCU Experience  The Book celebrates the rich legacy and experiences of those who attended HBCUs. This groundbreaking anthology chronicles undergraduate realities, such as dating and relationships, dorm living, road trips, pledging fraternities and sororities, student activism and leadership; athletics and more.  Further, with the debate still raging over the relevance and need for HBCUs in the new millennium, this collection of essays helps showcase the unique experiences of HBCU graduates, highlights the important need for these institutions and accentuates the overall benefits of having an HBCU education.
&quot;I love the HBCU Experience; there&#39;s nothing like it. Most of the people I hired as staff or interns through the years came from an HBCU, and the most prominent icons of the Civil Rights Movement came out of the HBCU Experience; which included stellar leaders like Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Congressman John Lewis, Ambassador Andrew Young, Stokely Carmichael, NAACP Leader Medgar Evers and Actor/Activist Ossie Davis.&quot;
-Jeff Burns, Jr., Author, &quot;The Brotherhood of Drew Hall&quot;
HBCU Experience - The Book is a fulfilling memoir. The book is a legacy to be treasured, with first-person accounts that offer readers an authentic reality as they learn or reminisce.
-Jannette L. Dates, Ph.D., Dean Emerita of the Howard University School of Communications; co-editor/primary author of Split Image: African Americans in the Mass Media and co-author of The Obamas and Mass Media: Race, Gender, Religion, and Politics
The HBCU culture and history is so rich that it deserves to have its stories told. As a custodian of the HBCU flame, I am thankful we have Tia and Chris to be our lions and this wonderful book to tell our tales.&quot;
-Michael J. Sorrell, Esq,. President of Paul Quinn College
&quot;Capturing the true essence of the HBCU experience is nearly impossible for people who are not HBCU alumni  until now. This book is a must-read for alums who want to reflect on the good old days and for high school students considering their college options.&quot;
