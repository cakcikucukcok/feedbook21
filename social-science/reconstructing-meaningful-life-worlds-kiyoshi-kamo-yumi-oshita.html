  <title>Reconstructing Meaningful Life Worlds - Kiyoshi Kamo, Yumi Oshita</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The future of social work in Japan is confused, unclear, and stagnant. A lot of social workers experience burnout because they have to help a wide variety of clients without the benefit of a consistently effective method. In &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reconstructing Meaningful Life Worlds: A New Approach to Social Work Practice&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, co-authors and practicing social workers Dr. Yumi Oshita and Kiyoshi Kamo present the fruitful results of ten years of researching social constructions and other related theories to develop a new paradigm of social work theory and practice.&lt;/p&gt;
Through identifying theoretical considerations, discussing levels of social structure, and providing skills and methods of measurement, Oshita and Kamo set the stage for their in-depth exploration of actual case studies in which their new social construction theory was used to develop effective intervention strategies. These strategies and principles, tested on a variety of clients in Japan, address a lack of vision in the theory and practice of social work in Japan today. Oshita and Kamos strategies can also help systematize methodology and increase the effectiveness of intervention in the field of social work around the globe. By striving to discover new theorization, we ensure the growth and survival of social work and open new worlds to those who need help most." />
