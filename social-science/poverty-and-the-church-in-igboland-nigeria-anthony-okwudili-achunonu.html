  <title>Poverty and the Church in Igboland, Nigeria - Anthony Okwudili Achunonu</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
    The main objective of this book is to re-evaluate the true meaning of the term poverty in the world as a whole and in Nigeria in particular. From a
    sociological point of view, poverty is the natural consequence of economic inequity amongst social groups, a type of inequity often generated by the
    inability of the political class to provide and maintain basic amenities in the society. This book highlights so many complex reasons that are responsible
    for this type of inability, prominent amongst them being mismanagement of funds in most political setups. Our investigation from this book shows that
    theres a great difference between the various forms of poverty in western countries and in other countries of the world.
    &lt;br/&gt;
    Poverty may be caused by individual, social, cultural, ethical and moral issues. These various causes of poverty are often correlated. In Nigeria, poverty
    is mainly caused by lack of moral sensitivities amongst political leaders and by lack of initiatives for cultural, social and economic empowerment of the
    less privileged. Most striking is the fact that there is no basic well-established governmental structure meant to assist those who languish in poverty.
    &lt;br/&gt;
    This book discusses the real-life situation of those who suffer and are living in abject poverty. The book also discusses proposals that can help improve
    their condition. In line with this, the effective contributions the church can make in order to fight poverty will be taken into consideration. In fact, it
    is not enough for the church to know that the situation of long-term injustice in Nigeria is crippling the country; rather, she has also to live up to her
    mission vis--vis the poor and the marginalised who are living in the country.
