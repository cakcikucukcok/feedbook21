  <title>Right Here, Right Now - Matthew Hennessey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Right Here, Right Now&lt;/i&gt;, Matthew Hennessey calls on his generation, Generation X, to take a stand against tech-obsessed Millennials, anti-free speech campus cupcakes, apathetic Baby Boomers, utopian Silicon Valley “visionaries,” and the menace to top them all: the soft totalitarian conspiracy known as the Internet of Things. Gen Xers, who are now in their 40s and early 50s, still have time to ride to the culture’s rescue by reminding everyone of the flesh-and-blood virtues of the human-scale world they grew up in. Soon they will be the only cohort of Americans who remember life as it was lived before the arrival of the Internet. They are, as Hennessey dubs them, “the last analog generation,” the sole remaining link to a time when childhood was still a bit dangerous but produced adults who were naturally resilient.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The latchkey kids of Gen X grew up without text messages and dating apps, so they learned how to look people in the eye when they asked them on a date or delivered bad news. They internalized the value of delayed gratification and the centrality of free speech to American democracy. For that matter, they believe in democracy, capitalism, and personal responsibility, while the tidal-wave generation coming up behind them—the much discussed Millennials—are increasingly blasé about the relative merits of these concepts. Gen X understood the importance of paying for entertainment, unlike today’s free-riding kids who interpret being asked to pay for content as an insult. Some of Gen X’s homes were broken by divorce, but they know well the value of the stable-family ideal. They even learned in school that sex had consequences and there are, in fact, only two genders.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;As a result of these and other factors, Gen X’s character and assumptions about the world were formed by an American culture that has been fading for the last 20 years. It’s the world of hardcover books, vinyl records, tape decks, and telephones with cords attached; it’s a world that believed patience was a virtue and privacy a treasure; it’s a world that took it as a given that a free and open society, in which people can say what they want and select their own political representatives without having to apologize, was objectively better than any other kind of society; and it’s a world that is rapidly disappearing in the rearview mirror.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Right Here, Right Now&lt;/i&gt; is a cultural history of the last 35 years in America, an analysis of the current socio-historical moment, and a generational call to arms. The Baby Boomers are exhausted. The Millennials are preoccupied with their gadgets and apps. In &lt;i&gt;Right Here, Right Now&lt;/i&gt;, Hennessey argues that the time has come for Generation X to stand up and be counted. This is their moment.&lt;/div&gt;" />
