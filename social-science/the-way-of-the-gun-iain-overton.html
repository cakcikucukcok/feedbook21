  <title>The Way of the Gun - Iain Overton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this compelling and revelatory book, an investigative journalist explores the lifecycle of the gun&amp;#8212;following those who make firearms, sell them, use them, and die by them&amp;#8212;with a special emphasis on the United States, to make sense of our complex relationship with these weapons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We live in the Age of the Gun. Around the globe, firearms are ubiquitous and define countless lives; in some places, it&amp;#8217;s even easier to get a gun than a glass of clean water. In others, it&amp;#8217;s legal to carry concealed firearms into bars and schools. In &lt;em&gt;The Way of the Gun&lt;/em&gt;, Iain Overton embarks on a remarkable journey to understand how these weapons have become an integral part of twenty-first century life, beyond the economics of supply and demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overton travels through more than twenty-five countries around the world and meets with ER doctors dealing with gun trauma, SWAT team leaders, gang members, and weapons smugglers. From visiting the most dangerous city in the world outside a war zone to the largest gun show on earth, his journey crosses paths with safari hunters and gun-makers, paralyzed victims and smooth-talking lobbyists. Weaving together their stories, Overton offers a portrait of distinct yet deeply connected cultures affected by the gun and from them draws out powerful insights into our weaponized world. Ultimately, he unearths some hard truths about the terrible realities of war and gun crime, and what can be done to stop it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eloquent and accessible, infused with compassion and humor, &lt;em&gt;The Way of the Gun&lt;/em&gt; is a riveting expose about guns and human beings that offers an eye-opening portrait of our time.&lt;/p&gt;" />
