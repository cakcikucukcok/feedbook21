  <title>On the Game - Sophie Day</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color=blue&gt;***Winner of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.medanthro.net/awards/basker.html&quot;&gt;Eileen Basker Prize&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.therai.org.uk/prizes/prizes.html#WellcomeMedal&quot;&gt;Wellcome Medal for Anthropology as Applied to Medical Problems&lt;/a&gt;.***&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
On the Game is an ethnographic account of prostitutes and prostitution. Sophie Day has followed the lives of individual women over fifteen years, and her book details their attempts to manage their lives against a backdrop of social disapproval. The period was one of substantial change within the sex industry.
Through the lens of public health, economics, criminalisation and human rights, Day explores how individual sex workers live, in public and in private. This offers a unique perspective on contemporary capitalist society that will be of interest both to a broad range of social scientists.
The author  brings a unique perspective to her work -- as both an anthropologist and the founder of the renowned Praed Street Project, set up in 1986, as a referral and support centre for London prostitutes." />
