  <title>Henry L. Stimson: The First Wise Man - David F. Schmitz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The twentieth century witnessed the rise of the United States as the preeminent player on the world stage. While many individuals were responsible for the American ascension, few have left a larger legacy in the arena of foreign policy than Henry L. Stimson. Serving nearly every American president from Theodore Roosevelt to Harry S. Truman, Stimson shaped America&#39;s worldview and influenced America&#39;s foreign affairs decisions for over 40 years.&lt;p&gt; A Republican, Stimson served as Secretary of War under William H. Taft (1911-13), Secretary of State under Herbert Hoover (1929-33), and Secretary of War for Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman (1940-45); in addition, he fought in World War I, initiated the Good Neighbor Policy in Central America, and served as Governor General of the Philippines (1927-29).&lt;/p&gt; In this new book, David Schmitz reveals how the life of Stimson provides a unique framework for analyzing America&#39;s foreign policy development from the imperialism of the 1890s to the origins of the Cold War and the emergence of the United States as the world&#39;s leading power after World War II. The author also explains the continuities in foreign policy over this period and the emergence of the internationalist perspective over isolation-ism, showing how Stimson was able to pass along his perspec-tives to the next generation of American policymakers who after World War II established the internationalist mindset of the Cold War years. Stimson&#39;s crucial role in the development and use of the atomic bomb is also examined.&lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;Henry L. Stimson: The First Wise Man&lt;/i&gt; is useful for courses in United States foreign policy, World War II, American history from 1900-1945, and survey courses in U.S. history." />
