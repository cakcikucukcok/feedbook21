  <title>The Values Algorithm - Flynn Coleman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Spirited, expansive, and universal, this is your personal guidebook to reimagining life in the Intelligent Machine Age and thriving in our brave new world&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The Intelligent Machine Age is upon us, and we are at a reflection point. We are already surrounded by fast-moving technologies, including forms of artificial intelligence. The proliferation of this extraordinary science will cause us to confront profound questions about ourselves: What does it mean to be human? What is the value of life itself? How can we find purpose and meaning in this next epoch of human existence? This is a unique moment, as we stand at the precipice of creating machines that are exponentially smarter than humans. The era of human intellectual superiority is ending, and, as a species, we need to plan for this monumental shift.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The Values Algorithm: How Artificial Intelligence Is Redefining What It Means to Be Human&lt;/i&gt; examines the immense impact intelligent technology will have on human rights and humanity in the face of sweeping change. It details how intelligent machines, like nothing before in history, will challenge some of our most deeply held beliefs and illustrates why it is critical that we instill values, ethics, and morals into our robots, algorithms, and other forms of AI. Equally important, Coleman emphasizes the need to develop and implement laws, policies, and oversight mechanisms to protect us from tech&#39;s insidious threats.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
To realize AI&#39;s transcendent promise, Coleman advocates for inviting a diverse group of voices to develop intelligent machines that place safeguarding human rights among the founding principles of emerging technologies. Ultimately, &lt;i&gt;The Values Algorithm&lt;/i&gt; is about much more than technology. It is about how our relationships with technology will lead us to redefine human rights and the very meaning of intelligence and consciousness." />
