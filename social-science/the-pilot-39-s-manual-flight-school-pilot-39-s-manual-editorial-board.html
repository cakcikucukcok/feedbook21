  <title>The Pilot&#39;s Manual: Flight School - Pilot&#39;s Manual Editorial Board</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This new 5th Edition has been updated throughout to reflect current FAA rules and the new Airman Certification Standards. 
Time is money in an airplane and with an instructor. The Pilot&#39;s Manual: Flight School will save readers on both as they progress through their Private and Commercial certificates. Flight instructors tell students which maneuvers will be covered in the next lesson; student can then prepare themselves by reading the relevant chapters and working the reviews.
The book can also be used with the post-flight briefing to consolidate what students practiced in the air. Flight instructors will benefit from better-prepared students, and students will benefit from more progress in their flight training.
The Pilot&#39;s Manual: Flight School covers all the tasks from the FAA Practical Test Standards for the Private and Commercial certificates, with text supported by more than 500 full-color illustrations and photographs. Students read about the maneuvers covered in their forthcoming lesson and gain both a theoretical and operational understanding of the tasks before heading to the airport. In addition to covering all the maneuvers, the book also prepares readers for the student pilot milestones: first solo, cross-country flying, instrument flight, and night flying.
The appendix provides a comprehensive airplane checkout review, which readers can use to prepare for transitioning to a new airplane type, insurance applications, or the Flight Review (BFR) ground lesson. This book makes it easy for students to learn the maneuvers before taking to the air, so their time spent in the airplane with an instructor can be dedicated to practice." />
