  <title>Justice While Black: Helping African-American Families Navigate and Survive the Criminal Justice System - Robbin Shipp, Nick Chiles</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;I&gt;Justice While Black&lt;/I&gt; is a must-read for every young black male in America&amp;#151;and for everyone else who cares about their survival and well-being. This is a first-of-its-kind essential guide for African-American families about how to understand the criminal justice system, and about why that system continues to see black men as targets&amp;#151;and as dollar signs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The book provides practical, straightforward advice on how to deal with specific legal situations: the threat of arrest, being arrested, being in custody, preparing for and undergoing a trial, and navigating the appeals and parole process. The primary goal of this book is to become a primer for African Americans on how to avoid becoming ensnared in the criminal justice system.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;While the precarious safety of black males has received renewed interest in the past year because of the deaths of teenagers Trayvon Martin and Jordan Davis, the fact is that this group has always been under threat from the armed guardians of the white social order. The tactics have been modernized, but the impact is still devastating&amp;#151;we are witnessing an epic criminalization of the African-American community at levels never before seen since the end of slavery.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
