  <title>Double Standard: Abuse Scandals and the Attack on the Catholic Church - David F. Pierre Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Yes, Catholic priests terribly abused minors, and bishops failed to stop the unspeakable harm. That is an undeniable truth. Nothing justifies such an evil. However, major media outlets are unfairly attacking the Catholic Church, and this fast-paced, compelling book has the shocking evidence to prove it. This book addresses numerous topics, including: &lt;br&gt;... appalling cases of abuse and cover-ups happening today - but they&amp;#39;re not happening in the Catholic Church&lt;br&gt;... proof that Catholic clergy do not offend more than teachers or those of other religious denominations&lt;br&gt;... data that shows that the Catholic clergy scandal is not about &amp;quot;pedophilia&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;... affirmation that the Catholic Church may be the safest environment for children today&lt;br&gt;... research that uncovers the shady relationships between SNAP (Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests), lawyers, and the media&lt;br&gt;... the alarming roots of SNAP&amp;#39;s attacks on the Church&lt;br&gt;... the surprising truth about &amp;quot;repressed memories&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;... unheard, agonized priests who deny the accusations against them&lt;br&gt;... evidence of how the &amp;quot;documentary&amp;quot; Deliver Us From Evil deceived moviegoers&lt;br&gt;plus much more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Double Standard covers topics that the major media won&amp;#39;t. There is no other book about the Catholic Church abuse narrative like this one." />
