  <title>Keep It Fake - Eric G. Wilson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Shoot straight from the hip. Tell it like it is. Keep it real. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We love these commands, especially in America, because they appeal to what we want to believe: that there&#39;s an authentic self to which we can be true. But while we mock Tricky Dick and Slick Willie, we&#39;re inventing identities on Facebook, paying thousands for plastic surgeries, and tuning in to news that simply verifies our opinions. Reality bites, after all, and becoming disillusioned is a downer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his new book &lt;i&gt;Keep It Fake: Inventing an Authentic Life&lt;/i&gt;, Eric G. Wilson investigates this phenomenon. Hedraws on neuroscience, psychology, sociology, philosophy, art, film, literature, and his own life to explore the possibility that there&#39;s no such thing as unwavering reality. Whether our left brains are shaping the raw data of our right into fabulous stories or we&#39;re so saturated by society&#39;s conventions that we&#39;re always acting out prefab scripts, we can&#39;t help but be phony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But is that really so bad? We&#39;re used to being scolded for being fake, but Wilson doesn&#39;t scold--because he doesn&#39;t think we need to be reprimanded. Our ability to remake ourselves into the people we want to be, or at least remake ourselves to &lt;i&gt;look &lt;/i&gt;like the people we want to be, is in fact a magical process that can be liberating in its own way. Because if we&#39;re all a bunch of fakes, shouldn&#39;t we embrace that? And if everything really is fake, then doesn&#39;t the fake become real--really?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In lively prose--honest, provocative, witty, wide-ranging (as likely to riff on Bill Murray as to contemplate Plato)--&lt;i&gt;Keep It Fake &lt;/i&gt;answers these questions, uncovering bracing truths about what it means to be human and helping us turn our necessary lying into artful living.&lt;/p&gt;" />
