  <title>Nice Place, Shame About the Human Race - Allan Gilmour</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; He knew the earth experiment was still working even though the human-element component was running very much behind schedule. Tommy made a grumbling sound and slowly shook his furry head from side to side, crying, Wars, greed, jealousy, illnesses, unhappiness, dissatisfaction, obsessions for power - Its just not what I had expected! &lt;br /&gt;I know, but give it time. It will happen one day. The earth assignment is not as old as all the other projects we have been working upon, Eric hastily reassured. Tommy was not about to give up on the present venture and with this thought in mind, he stared with his numerous eyes into Erics multiple eyes, and with many worrisome looks he mumbled, &lt;br /&gt; ..its a nice place, shame about the human race!&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The above is an extract taken from the final piece of my foreword for the book Nice place, shame about the human race which attempts to create a better awareness of our everyday actions and elucidates the importance of discovering ones true identity for a better chance of living a happier, more balanced life. Mounting dissatisfactions and insecurities of our modern world, together with the general inquisitiveness of human nature to wish observe ones actions, are areas of modern life which have gained popularity over the last decade when searching for reasoning or answers to our everyday problems. Commencing at the aftermath of World War II and continuing to the present day, a journey is undertaken in trying to illustrate modern western societys increased negative attitudes and behaviour and of the importance of discovering who we really are with a view to more personal happiness. This book is an entertaining, slightly ironical check-in-the-mirror, if you like, of modern behaviour. It observes how modern society has seemingly done away with aspiring to reach higher goals and standards, and at the same time, appears to have become content with mediocrity and of aiming towards lower levels of existence. &lt;br /&gt;My main justifications for writing such a book were primarily based upon the search for answers as to why society in the modern western world has reached its present state of development in the constitution of which it finds itself in the present day; if it is possible to live modern life in a more balanced, friendlier frame-of-mind which would inexorably, lead to more happiness, and as an attempt to help you, the reader, into being more aware of our daily conscious and subconscious conduct towards fellow-citizens and of the ensuing consequences of those actions. &lt;br /&gt;We are to journey through the many different stages of modern western life as based upon our upbringing in an industrialised society; and although you may have heard some of the themes and topics many times before, I have attempted to pick out the quintessence of noting how individuals react within the confines of our various societies and communal boundaries. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What type of person is Nice place, shame about the human race aimed for? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well basically, anybody who is still interested about the values of our modern society, but specifically, when amid the interference and confusion of modern society, one is searching for personal direction into discovering oneself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emphasis has been placed upon the significance of living ones own individuality, thus being aware of who one really is, and of the importance of taking more self-responsibility for ones actions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a short list of reasons compiled for those who would possibly find my work of interest. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. If feeling a little out-of-touch with our fast-paced modern society. &lt;br /&gt;2. When interested in achieving more personal awareness in everyday activities. &lt;br /&gt;3. When concerned about societies present course of development. &lt;br /&gt;4. When trying to understand modern societies push and shove mentality. &lt;br /&gt;5.
