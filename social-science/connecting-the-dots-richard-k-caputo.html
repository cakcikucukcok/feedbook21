  <title>Connecting the Dots - Richard K. Caputo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Richard K. Caputo, an under-the-radar social work scholar, shares lessons about finding his voice as a scholar, overcoming obstacles, and navigating the rigors and expectations of academia in this memoir.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From his days as an undergraduate to a graduate student; from being a paraprofessional at Arizona State Hospital and Division of Behavioral Health Services to a professional social worker at a family service agency then known as United Charities of Chicago; and from an agency-based professional to an academic, he reveals the trials, tribulations, and tradeoffs that went with each transition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also pays homage to the mentors that helped him succeed in his various roles, including being a junior faculty member at the University of Pennsylvania School of Social Work, a continuing contract faculty member at the Barry University School of Social Work, and finally as a tenured faculty member at the Yeshiva University Wurzweiler School of Social Work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join the author as he chronicles his journey navigating the political and social environment from the 1960s through the 2010s and juggling the demands of university life in Connecting the Dots.&lt;/p&gt;" />
