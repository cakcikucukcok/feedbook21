      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;The new Fourth Edition of James E. Ellis&#39; handy and comprehensive guide is now available in eBook format. If you&#39;ve been flirting with the idea of purchasing a private plane, this book provides key assistance toward helping you make that dream become a reality.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Buying an airplane isn&#39;t an easy task, but it doesn&#39;t have to be difficult, either.
