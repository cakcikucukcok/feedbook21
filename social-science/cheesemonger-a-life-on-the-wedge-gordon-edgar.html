  <title>Cheesemonger: A Life on the Wedge - Gordon Edgar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Witty and irreverent, informative and provocative, &lt;em&gt;Cheesemonger: A Life on the Wedge&lt;/em&gt; is the highly readable story of Gordon Edgar&#39;s unlikely career as a cheesemonger at San Francisco&#39;s worker-owned Rainbow Grocery Cooperative. A former punk-rock political activist, Edgar bluffed his way into his cheese job knowing almost nothing, but quickly discovered a whole world of amazing artisan cheeses. There he developed a deep understanding and respect for the styles, producers, animals, and techniques that go into making great cheese.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;With a refreshingly unpretentious sensibility, Edgar intertwines his own life story with his ongoing love affair with cheese, and offers readers an unflinching, highly entertaining on-the-ground look at America&#39;s growing cheese movement. From problem customers to animal rights, business ethics to taste epiphanies, this book offers something for everyone, including cheese profiles and recommendations for selecting the very best-not just the most expensive-cheeses from the United States and around the world and a look at the struggles dairy farmers face in their attempts to stay on and make their living from the land.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Edgar-a smart, progressive cheese man with an activist&#39;s edge-enlightens and delights with his view of the world from behind the cheese counter and his appreciation for the skill and tradition that go into a good wedge of Morbier.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cheesemonger&lt;/em&gt; is the first book of its kind-a cheese memoir with attitude and information that will appeal to everyone from serious foodies to urban food activists.&lt;/p&gt;" />
