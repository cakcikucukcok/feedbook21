  <title>The Outsourced Self - Arlie Russell Hochschild</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From the famed author of the bestselling &lt;i&gt;The Second Shift&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Time Bind&lt;/i&gt;, a pathbreaking look at the transformation of private life in our for-profit world&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The family has long been a haven in a heartless world, the one place immune to market forces and economic calculations, where the personal, the private, and the emotional hold sway. Yet as Arlie Russell Hochschild shows in &lt;i&gt;The Outsourced Self&lt;/i&gt;, that is no longer the case: everything that was once part of private life--love, friendship, child rearing--is being transformed into packaged expertise to be sold back to confused, harried Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drawing on hundreds of interviews and original research, Hochschild follows the incursions of the market into every stage of intimate life. From dating services that train you to be the CEO of your love life to wedding planners who create a couple&#39;s &quot;personal narrative&quot;; from nameologists (who help you name your child) to wantologists (who help you name your goals); from commercial surrogate farms in India to hired mourners who will scatter your loved one&#39;s ashes in the ocean of your choice--Hochschild reveals a world in which the most intuitive and emotional of human acts have become work for hire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sharp and clear-eyed, Hochschild is full of sympathy for overstressed, outsourcing Americans, even as she warns of the market&#39;s threat to the personal realm they are striving so hard to preserve.&lt;/p&gt;" />
