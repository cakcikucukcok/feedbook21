  <title>Gray Divorce - Jocelyn Elise Crowley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="After twenty, thirty, or even forty years of marriage, countless vacations together, raising well-adjusted children, and sharing property and finances&amp;mdash;what could go wrong?&amp;#160;&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;#160;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;I&gt;The&amp;#160;Gray&amp;#160;Divorce&lt;/I&gt;&amp;#160;offers a provocative look at the growing rate of marital splits after the age of 50, showcasing the voices of men and women who are considering, going through, or have undergone one.&amp;#160; With empathy and insight, Jocelyn Crowley, who has written widely on family issues, uncovers the reasons for why men and women&amp;#160;divorce&amp;mdash;and the penalties and benefits that each pay for their choice. From the outside, many may ask why couples in mid-life and readying for retirement choose to make a drastic change in their marital status. Yet nearly 1 out of every 4&amp;#160;divorces&amp;#160;is &amp;ldquo;gray.&amp;rdquo; Crowley sheds light on why&amp;#160;divorce&amp;#160;occurs&amp;mdash;seeing marriage in a different lens, understanding the seismic shift in individual priorities, and the impact of the increase in life expectancy. With a deft eye, she analyzes the experiences of women and men as they go through this life transition&amp;mdash;specifically how women are affected economically while men are affected socially. With a realistic yet passionate voice, Crowley shares the personal positive outlooks and the necessary supportive public policies that must take place to best help new divorcees. Engaging and instructive,&amp;#160;&lt;I&gt;The&amp;#160;Gray&amp;#160;Divorce&lt;/I&gt;&amp;#160;is a must-read for anyone interested in contemporary American culture.&lt;BR /&gt;" />
