  <title>Stop Falling for the Okeydoke - Stephen A. Tillett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The United States of America has been plagued by a critical birth defect since its founding: the idea that race matters.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Stephen A. Tillett, an Air Force veteran and pastor for the past 27 years, argues that race is a social construct and has no basis in science. But sadly, it has permeated every aspect of American life for hundreds of years.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The Bible has been prescient in speaking to this regrettable dynamic: &quot;What has been will be again, what has been done will be done again; there is nothing new under the sun.&quot; (Ecclesiastes 1:9).&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Instead of focusing on obstacles that we all face and dreams we all share, race and racism has kept people of common interests artificially divided. As Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said, &quot;We must learn to live together as brothers [and sisters] or perish together as fools.&quot;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To do what King suggested, we must stop making vigorous assertions about assumptions that are demonstrably untrue. We must stop believing in ideas that have a visceral appeal but lead to immoral outcomes. We must Stop Falling for the Okeydoke.&lt;/p&gt;
