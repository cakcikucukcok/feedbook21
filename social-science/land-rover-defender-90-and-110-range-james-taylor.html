  <title>Land Rover Defender, 90 and 110 Range - James TAYLOR</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Land Rover Defender, 90 and 110 Range - 30 Years of the Coil-Spring 4x4 Models charts the evolution of the coil-sprung Defender vehicles. When Land Rover switched from leaf springs to coil springs for their utility models in 1983, it was a major step forward. The first coil-sprung model, the One Ten, replaced the Series III 109s. The short-wheelbase Ninety replaced the Series III 88s in 1984. From 1990, the models were all re-branded as Land Rover Defenders - 90, 110 and 140 - as the Land Rover range expanded and the marketing teams wanted a new name.Topics covered include: Origins of the Defender and early Ninety and One Ten Models; Development and use of the long-wheelbase models; Special conversions and Defenders built outside the UK, including in Australia and South Africa; Military and emergency service use of the Defender; Detailed examinations of engines and engineering, and the focus on diesel power; The future of the Defender. Charts the evolution of the coil-sprung Defender vehicles - the early 90 and 110 models from 1983 to present day. A must buy for all Land Rover enthusiasts. Superbly illustrated with 300 colour photographs. James Taylor is a well-known writer on classic motoring and a specialist on the Land Rover marque." />
