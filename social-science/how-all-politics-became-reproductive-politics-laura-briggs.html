  <title>How All Politics Became Reproductive Politics - Laura Briggs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book tells the story of how U.S. political struggles over race, immigration, and queer folks came to center around reproductive politics&amp;mdash;children, households, and families. The political movement for neoliberalism accomplished its goals in particular through race-based shaming of irresponsible reproductive behavior&amp;mdash;from an account of Black &amp;ldquo;welfare queens&amp;rdquo; and Latina immigrant &amp;ldquo;breeding machines&amp;rdquo; to Clinton&amp;rsquo;s crackdown on immigration following &amp;ldquo;Nannygate.&amp;rdquo; These racialized reproductive politics were instrumental in creating a new normal: the shredding of the government safety net for families and households, the end of the period of rising real wages and a living wage that enabled people to support families and dependents, and the immiseration of households&amp;mdash;not just as less money, but also as time famine, later reproduction, structural infertility, the stress particularly in communities of color leading to disproportionate infant mortality rates, and the turn to same-sex marriage in queer politics because legally recognized &amp;ldquo;family&amp;rdquo; is all that protects us in the absence of a social safety net. Donald Trump, who campaigned with the old racist promise to white people: your pockets are empty because of people of color (immigrants and Black criminals); put your faith in the white ruling class (we&amp;rsquo;ll keep your wages low but you&amp;rsquo;ll get to feel superior to non-white people), offering &amp;ldquo;globalization&amp;rdquo; as the name of the problem, a racialized boogey-man of immigrants and free trade agreements, in place of neoliberalism--the political movement among the 1% to shrink government, unions, and wages and redistribute wealth upwards. This book argues for the critical importance of paying attention to reproductive politics in this new era.&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;#160;" />
