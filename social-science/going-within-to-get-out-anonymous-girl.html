  <title>Going Within to Get Out - Anonymous Girl</title>
      <meta name="description" content="...the minute I picked this book up I was on an emotional rollercoaster. It was the most amazing journey to find myself crying one minute and laughing the next with the authors infectious wit and undeniable honesty. The diary entries are so raw and vulnerable, and have been written in a way that I have never experienced before. I identified with many things throughout the book and found myself recalling significant events from my own adolescent years that I believed I had blocked or forgotten about. At times it felt like there was nowhere to hide; the words I was reading were so confronting it felt as though they were written just for me! Taking this journey with the author allowed me to deal with what was coming up for me personally, and move past those feelings to a place that felt good for me. With every page that I read I couldnt believe how I was not only totally enthralled in the authors personal life story, but that I was actually also uncovering so much about who I am as a person at my very core. It allowed me to discover the parts of myself that I didnt like or accept yet, and also how to recognise this in my day-to-day life. I have now learned to accurately identify my feelings in each moment of my day, and with some conscious effort also remember to be much more kind and loving towards myself. I thank the writer of this book for allowing me a glimpse into her own life through courageously sharing and exposing her soul. What I have gained from reading it is without a doubt the best gift anyone could ever give." />
