  <title>A Social History - William A. C. Polk</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This social history is not just an autobiography. The emphasis of this personal history to is to demonstrate that Social History develops as a consequence of interactions and relationships between human beings. Not one of us consciously sets out to change the world, but minuscule changes resulting from our presence, causes us, without being aware of it, to leave an imprint on all humanity. Reflection on these two facts can generate realization that every human being on earth can and does effect change in the human condition. Consequently, few of us realize how significant our life existence really is, until someone reminds us that our presence made a host of differences in their own lives. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=justify&gt;Once we become aware of this truth, we can record expositions such as this one. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=justify&gt;After 87 years of living, the mountaintops and the valleys of my life have become --only in hindsight --a tangible part of our country&#39;s Social History. All I have done here is what I hope many more of you can, and will do --record your own history, and enjoy the vision of how your interactions with people helped to shape you, your family, your community, your society and the world. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=justify&gt;What is Life all about? Are you important to all humanity? The answer to the second question---- OH YES YOU ARE!! That&#39;s what I&#39;ve tried to show you here. &lt;/P&gt;
