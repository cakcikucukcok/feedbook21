  <title>Bus Stop: bus riding poems - Laurent the Lion</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Bus Stop&amp;quot; is a collection of poetry all about riding the city bus. Straight forward narrative poetry with a musical quality that represents the humor and curiosity of people watching in the busy urban scene. The emotions are far ranging while the central theme is optimism and wonder. In this collection you will find businessmen and bums, retirees and young punks, anger and laughter, early mornings and late nights and everything people do to cope with the situations. In reading this book you will find you know these people and some of them you might even like. Well like them or not, the people, places and actions described in this poetry collection gives us a reflection of who we are and where we place ourselves in the city crowded with random faces. In &amp;quot;Bus Stop&amp;quot; all those random faces become the personalities that we wittingly or unwittingly defines ourselves by through our interactions. There we find the confirmations and surprises of the social situation where nothing is predictable in the comfort and discomfort of trying to find a common ground. Amazingly most of the time we do get along and the poems in &amp;quot;Bus Stop&amp;quot; primarily puts a smile on these small victories of daily confrontations&lt;/p&gt;" />
