  <title>Schaller&#39;s Politically Incorrect Conservalexicon - Joseph Schaller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="We live in an Orwellian political world of propaganda and indoctrination. Deception is the method for grasping power and control. Dedicated Republicans are even confused regarding history, economics, science, and conservative principles. I present a list of appetizing words, terms, expressions, myths, facts, and definitions conflicting with the prevailing paradigm of acceptable ideology, language, and notions of political correctness. My lexicon is meant as an essential resource for any and all who seek to achieve enlightenment and break the cycle of cultural indoctrination.
Rather than read a book from front to back, my lexicon allows you to surf through a menu of appetizers, skipping those that may not appeal to your palate while still lingering at a buffet of goodies represented in your chosen chapter.
POLITICAL CORRECTNESS 
1.   A scheme of social engineering and propaganda. 
2.  The politically correct term for Cultural Marxism, a systematic method to punish dissent and to stigmatize social heresy. Its trademark is intolerance, classifying its adversaries as haters, or mentally ill.
3.  PC for short (or BS), it means conforming to a particular sociopolitical ideology or point of view.
4.  As the new age bully, PC can be any true statement that has been transformed into a lie to control or mislead the weak minded or used as a  weapon of intimidation to silence any and all criticism of a leftist authoritarian political agenda.
5.  PC is the conscious, designed manipulation of language intended to change the way people speak, write, think, feel, and act, in furtherance of an agenda.
6.   PC is also the MO for revisionist history.
  POLITICAL INCORRECTNESS
 1.  For the most part, factually correct.     2. Shinola" />
