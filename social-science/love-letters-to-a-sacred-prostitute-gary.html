  <title>Love Letters to a Sacred Prostitute - Gary</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A spiritual and knowledgeable woman once told me that I was a Sacred Prostitute. She explained that a Sacred Prostitute is someone who soothes, nurtures and heals another and then sends them on their way to find their true destiny, a better, more emotionally complete person for the experience. I was initially confused, but eventually relieved and elated by this possibility. I sometimes felt guilty because it wasn&#39;t possible for me to ignore a woman who was strong or beautiful or talented or sweet. I had many deep but relatively short lived relationships. I was in love with many of these women. I respected and admired every single one of them. I found them simply amazing. I was never looking for notches on a bedpost, only searching for my one true Love. Many left me and moved on, found another. I was left alone, again and again, wondering...But maybe there was a reason for such an active lovelife. 
Maybe I really am a Sacred Prostitute! 
After all, very few of the women seemed to hate me when we parted. And most were married shortly after their time spent with me. I can&#39;t tell you why I was chosen as a Sacred Prostitute. I can&#39;t tell you how to become one yourself. But, in this book, I share the journeys, the thoughts and passions of 89 women that loved one, in their own words." />
