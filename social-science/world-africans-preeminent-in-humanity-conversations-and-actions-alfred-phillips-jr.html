  <title>World Africans, Preeminent in Humanity: Conversations and Actions - Alfred Phillips Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Who are you? How you see yourself may determine what you get out of reading this book. If you see yourself as an Abrahamic-myth believer (Jew, Christian, and Muslim), then you may revile this book. If you see yourself as a person of faith, you may simply think that I am grossly mistaken. If you see yourself as one for whom world-African lives matter, you may see this book as worthwhile. 
I regard myself as a thinking free man first, a world African second, and a citizen of the US third. I am also a father of five excellent sons, a physicist-scientist, a marathoner, a man fortunate to have loved a few women with occasional reciprocity, and a male whose loving parents wanted to have me.
This work presents a self-reliant way forward for world-African people. It is based upon a new vision for world Africans, a world-African government, world-African green businesses, and the creation of scientific spirituality. There are two major impediments world Africans face: first, exploitation by white people, and second, the Abrahamic-myth Belief System (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam). Unfortunately, many world Africans have completely bought into these mutually warring religions. This work offers ways to overcome these two impediments.
I believe that world Africans, often with US African initiatives, can drive the world positively. Some of us are beginning to realize how we see ourselves matters in the matter of our lives and the matters we courageously try to realize." />
