  <title>Brainless: The Lies and Lunacy of Ann Coulter - Joe Maguire</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;She is an uncompromising apologist for the right and a hater of all things left. Is there anything she won&#39;t do or say to further her agenda? The answer is no.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brainless: The Lies and Lunacy of Ann Coulter&lt;/em&gt; is an unbridled look at a woman who twists the truth, misleads, plays loose with facts and allusions, and has been accused of plagiarism in hammering home her logic-defying arguments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brainless&lt;/em&gt; illustrates the dangers, ironies, and hypocrisies of the Mistress of Malice. She spews her venom generously across the spectrum. Democrats and Liberals are just the beginning. If you&#39;re a woman (you shouldn&#39;t vote), gay (you&#39;re going to hell), a 9/11 widow (dancing on your murdered husband&#39;s grave) or Bill Clinton (slurs and charges too numerous to mention here), you will find yourself the object of her ire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now it&#39;s time to turn the tables and take a good hard look at the High Priestess of Hypocrisy. Journalist Joe Maguire takes apart her arguments, picks apart her agenda, and gives us a look at the psychology and background of the woman who has reduced public political and cultural debate to browbeating and name-calling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diligently researched (with source notes you can verify!), Maguire separates fact from myth and gives us an unvarnished look at the REAL Ann Coulter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s face it. You don&#39;t ever want to read a book by Ann Coulter. Read this so you don&#39;t have to!&lt;/p&gt;" />
