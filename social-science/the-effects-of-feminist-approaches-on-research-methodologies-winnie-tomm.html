  <title>The Effects of Feminist Approaches on Research Methodologies - Winnie Tomm</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Effects of Feminist Approaches on Research Methodologies&lt;/i&gt; is about feminist approaches to research in twelve disciplines. The authors look at whether there is something called feminist methodology, whether there are several feminist methodologies, or whether feminists use existing methodologies from a feminist perspective. The answers vary according to individuals and disciplines. The anthology shows that feminist perspectives used in any discipline include an interdisciplinary approach. Feminist use methods which take into account the effect of social and cultural values on academic research. The influence of the social relations of the sexes on research in the sciences, social sciences, dance, and humanities is discussed. The aim of feminist research is to overcome the widespread sexism in the selection, interpretation, and communication of research data by focusing on issues concerning women, reinterpreting historical theories, reconstitution the meaning of knowledge, and communicating new understandings. These feminist authors look at the purpose of knowledge, and communicating new understandings. These feminist authors look at the purpose of knowledge and the issue of whose knowledge is communicated in academic research., The methods they use are designed to shed light on otherwise dark areas and to critique those areas of academic knowledge that have been in the spotlight for centuries." />
