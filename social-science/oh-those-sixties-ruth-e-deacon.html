  <title>Oh! Those Sixties - Ruth E. Deacon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div class=Section1&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;This novel portrays vivid
insights into the lives of individuals caught up in the various issues and
events during the later years of the Sixties. The earlier years of the decade
of brewing unrest are treated through flashbacks or memory comments that clarify
current activity. The late Sixties contained the mounting pressures. Characters
represent a wide range of perspectives--parental confusion and/or support, &lt;span
class=SpellE&gt;tten&lt;/span&gt; independence, protesters of injustice, defenders of
the status quo, impatience with the status quo, evaders of issues, &lt;span
class=GramE&gt;workers&lt;/span&gt; for justice, Vietnam as necessary or evil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;The turmoil and complexity of the
sixties are well known, but the issues are generally treated independently to
provide a depth of understanding. This novel provides avenues for seeing all
the issues in related contexts to help sharpen overall perceptions of the
period. How could such a range of conflicting problems and issues coalesce and
demand solution at the same time? To wit: racial discrimination, intervention
in Vietnam, drug use, gender inequities, university roles, and changing mores.
However it happened, individuals needed to respond. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;Are we better off for the travail
of the Sixties? Would positive changes have occurred without such a conflicting
time? Read and wonder.&lt;/p&gt;
