  <title>Cruel and Usual Punishment - Nonie Darwish</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Nonie Darwish lived for thirty years in a majority Muslim nation. Everything about her life?family, sexuality, hygiene, business, banking, contracts, economics, politics, social issues, everything?was dictated by the Islamic law code known as Sharia.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;But Sharia isn&#39;t staying in majority Muslim nations. Darwish now lives in the West and brings a warning; the goal of radical Islam is to bring Sharia law to &lt;I&gt;your&lt;/I&gt; country. If that happens, the fabric of Western law and liberty will be ripped in two. Under Sharia law: &lt;/P&gt; &lt;UL&gt; &lt;LI&gt;A woman can be beaten for talking to men who are not her relatives and flogged for not wearing a headdress&lt;/LI&gt; &lt;LI&gt;Daughters, sisters, and wives can be legally killed by the men in their family&lt;/LI&gt; &lt;LI&gt;Non-Muslims can be beheaded, and their Muslim killers will not receive the death penalty&lt;/LI&gt; &lt;LI&gt;Certain kinds of child molestation are allowed&lt;/LI&gt; &lt;LI&gt;The husband of a &quot;rebellious&quot; wife can deny her medical care or place her under house arrest&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt; &lt;P&gt;Think it can&#39;t happen? In 2008, England?once the seat of Western liberty and now the home of many Muslim immigrants?declared that Sharia courts in Britain have the force of law.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;When Muslim populations reach as little as 1 or 2 percent, says Darwish, they begin making demands of the larger community, such as foot-level faucets for washing before praying in public schools, businesses, and airports. &quot;Airports in Kansas City, Phoenix, and Indianapolis are among those who have already installed foot baths for Muslim cab drivers,&quot; writes Darwish. These demands test how far Westerners will go in accommodating the Muslim minority. How far will they push? The Organization of the Islamic Conference works to Islamize international human rights laws and apply Sharia &quot;standards&quot; for blasphemy to all nations. The penalty for blasphemy? Death.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Weaving personal experience together with extensive documentation and research, Darwish exposes the facts and reveals the global threat posed by Sharia law. Anyone concerned about Western rights and liberties ignores her warning and analysis at their peril.&lt;/P&gt;" />
