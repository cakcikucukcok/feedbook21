  <title>Stalking the Red Bear - Peter Sasgen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thrilling submarine espionage and an inside look at the U.S. Navy&#39;s &quot;silent service&quot; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Stalking the Red Bear&lt;/i&gt;, for the first time ever, describes the action principally from the perspective of a commanding officer of a nuclear submarine during the Cold War -- the one man aboard a sub who makes the critical decisions -- taking readers closer to the Soviet target than any work on submarine espionage has ever done before. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the untold story of a covert submarine espionage operation against the Soviet Union during the Cold War as experienced by the Commanding Officer of an active submarine. Few individuals outside the intelligence and submarine communities knew anything about these top-secret missions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloaking itself in virtual invisibility to avoid detection, the &lt;i&gt;USS Blackfin &lt;/i&gt;went sub vs. sub deep within Soviet-controlled waters north of the Arctic Circle, where the risks were extraordinarily high and anything could happen. Readers will know what it was like to carry out a covert mission aboard a nuke and experience the sights, sounds, and dangers unique to submarining.&lt;/p&gt;" />
