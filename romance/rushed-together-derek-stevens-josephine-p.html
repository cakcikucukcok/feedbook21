  <title>Rushed Together - Derek Stevens, Josephine P.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What could have happened to two complete strangers that got them handcuffed to a hotel bed two thousand miles from home?&lt;br /&gt;
He doesn&amp;rsquo;t know. He doesn&amp;#39;t even know who he is.&lt;br /&gt;
She doesn&amp;rsquo;t know. All she knows is that she shouldn&amp;#39;t be there, dressed as a bride in a honeymoon suite. Why is she there? And how did she end up in that white dress?&lt;br /&gt;
Nothing seems to make sense and when things seem to be getting better, they find fake documents for both, a semiautomatic Colt, a positive pregnancy test and two shady individuals set to find them at all costs!&lt;br /&gt;
There is no time to think or to remember, they must escape to be able to understand what the hell happened the day before, of which neither remembers anything.&lt;br /&gt;
An escape filled with twists, where every certainty collapses miserably, every memory is distorted by what they will discover and where destiny plays its card each time.&lt;br /&gt;
A journey that will lead the two protagonists to travel throughout America to the final twist.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Rushed Together&amp;quot; is a novel full of suspense, mystery and action with a comic and romantic twist to it." />
