  <title>Various States of Undress: Georgia - Laura Simcox</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Laura Simcox concludes her fun, flirty Various States of Undress series with a presidential daughter, a hot baseball player, and a tale of love at the ballgame.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forget being the president&#39;s daughter&amp;#8212;Georgia Fulton is certain that she&#39;s on her way to journalistic stardom. Nothing&#39;s going to keep her from getting the story of her young career&amp;#8212;a feature on sexy ballplayer Brett Knox &amp;#8230; nothing except Brett, that is. Arrogantly charming and hotter than a Memphis summer, he&#39;s doing everything he can to distract her. He may be the focus of her assignment, but getting too close to him could cost her everything &amp;#8230; including her heart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brett Knox, star player for the Memphis Redbirds, is determined to get to the big leagues&amp;#8212;which means no distractions. Certainly not in the form of a sexy brunette who won&#39;t take no for an answer. As far as Brett&#39;s concerned, his life story isn&#39;t up for discussion&amp;#8212;no matter how fast Georgia makes his heart race. But with everything on the line, he&#39;s got no choice but to trust her. If only he can trust himself &amp;#8230; not to fall head over heels for the one girl completely out of his league.  &lt;/p&gt;" />
