  <title>Far from Heaven - Cherrie Lynn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ashemnon&#39;s demonic hunger for Madeleine Dean&#39;s pure, vibrant soul has tormented him throughout every lifetime she&#39;s lived on earth. Now, thanks to her desperate father, he has a blood-tight contract in hand. Soon, her soul will belong to him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All her life, Maddie has been haunted by strange occurrences, hallucinations and increasingly intense nightmares. As her ex-boyfriend walks away, she can almost hear the pieces of her life falling around her. And then she falls--literally--into the arms of a stranger who&#39;s the first and only person to understand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ash meant to pluck her soul, not sweep her off her feet. Yet the moment they touch, the temptation to seduce her again and again is more than he can resist. Despite the risk, he finds himself succumbing to her charms. And, impossibly, falling in love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then Ash learns the reason it&#39;s taken centuries to get to this point: He&#39;s not the only one with a claim on her soul. Heaven and Hell are in a tug of war--and Maddie&#39;s the rope. Control wrested from his hands, Ash can only wait for her to make a choice that will damn one soul to Hell...or damn her own.&lt;/p&gt;" />
