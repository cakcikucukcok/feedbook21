  <title>Meeting - Hollie Delaney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For Victoria Hamilton things were getting odd.  The guy at the library staring at her without embarrassment.  The same guy standing on the snow covered street in the dark.  Then again across from her office in broad daylight on the coldest day of the year.  An email referral from some long quiet foreign Clients.  The subsequent phone call from an unknown lawyer followed by an email from his employer describing requirements for a property not to exceed ten million dollars. Now that waswellvery odd.
Victorias life was finally working for her.  No complaints.  Kids grown and definitely living their own lives.  A well situated condo that contained only her necessities.  A boutique real estate brokerage functioning within her business model that treated her well.  She could buy her lattes, pay her bills and have the occasional tryst if someone struck her fancy.  After all the starts and stops in her life, Victoria understood that she was marking time.  She was fine with it. 
But the usually quiet winter was getting just plain weird.
