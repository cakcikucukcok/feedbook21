  <title>Live for Tomorrow - Nancy Hann Skroko</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Karina Winkler loves her job at a mens haberdashery in Aachen, Germany. When she assists a handsome WWI German soldier with a purchase, she never dreams that her brief encounter would lead to a date and spellbinding romance. When they fall head over heels in love, Karina discovers that Derek von Kampler is a baron and heir to Castle Royale. On leave, recovering from an injury, Derek invites Karina to the castle to meet his father, Baron von Kampler, and his aristocratic family. Despite feeling intimidated by the obvious disapproval of the Baroness and Fredericka, Dereks tempestuous sister, Karina accepts Dereks marriage proposal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sadly, their time together is brief due to Dereks orders to report back to his regiment. Karina suddenly finds herself a newlywed and left alone to face the hatred of her husbands family. When tragedy strikes, Karina finds an ally in Nana, Dereks long-ago governess. Grief-stricken, Karina agonizes over revealing a shocking secret, but she never realizes how this revelation will put her life and those she loves in mortal danger. When threats are made on her life, Karina desperately prays for Gods protection as she searches for an answer to her dilemma. Trapped in postwar occupied Germany, Karina prays for a miracle that will allow her to survive and protect those entrusted to her loving care.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
