I already don&#39;t trust men and Logan&#39;s arrival at my Blood Center may put me out of a job.

  	<div class="indent justify" style="visibility:hidden"><b><i>Biting Me Softly - Mary Hughes</i></b> | Biting Me Softly by Mary Hughes is a good read. I am a fan of this series and this was a good addition to it. I loved Logan. He is a hot, sexy alpha vampire with a sense of humor and a tender side. I have to say I liked but did not love Liese. To me she came across as too neurotic and I found her personality kind of grating.<br /><b><i>Biting Me Softly (Biting Love Series) by Mary Hughes</i></b> | Biting Me Softly is no different. Liese Schmetterling is a self-professed geek with trust issues a mile wide. She works for Meiers Corners' Blood Bank doing just about everything, including manning the front desk and keeping track of inventory.<br /><b><i>Amazon.com: Biting Me Softly (A Biting Love Romance ...</i></b> | Biting Me Softly (Biting Love) Paperback â€“ December 3, 2017 by Mary Hughes (Author)<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Biting Me Softly - Mary Hughes</a> </h3></p><hr/>
