  <title>Fitzwilliam Darcy, Rock Star - Heather Rigaud</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Darcy&#39;s as hot as he is talented...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fast music, powerful beats, and wild reputations-on and off stage-have made virtuoso guitarist Fitzwilliam Darcy&#39;s band into rock&#39;s newest bad boys. But they&#39;ve lost their latest opening act, and their red-hot summer tour is on the fast track to disaster. Now Darcy and bandmates Charles Bingley and Richard Fitzwilliam are about to meet their match...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;But she&#39;s about to rock his world...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Enter Elizabeth Bennet, fiercely independent star of girl-band Long Borne Suffering. Elizabeth, her sister Jane, and friend Charlotte Lucas have talent to spare and jump at the opening band slot. Elizabeth is sure she&#39;s seen the worst the music industry has to offer. But as the days and nights heat up, it becomes clear that everyone is in for a summer to remember.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What readers say:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;An amazing writer... a magical ride.&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;An absolutely wonderful, funny, sexy, realistic, beautifully written story.&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Thank you for the wild, touching, raunchy, sweet, sexy, witty, intelligent, down-and-dirty ride.&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Amazing characters and absolutely fascinating plot! I&#39;m still breathless after reading it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Darcy&#39;s as hot as he is talented...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fast music, powerful beats, and wild reputations-on and off stage-have made virtuoso guitarist Fitzwilliam Darcy&#39;s band into rock&#39;s newest bad boys.
