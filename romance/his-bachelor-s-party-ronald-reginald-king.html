  <title>His Bachelor’S Party - Ronald Reginald King</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Myster Mychael DLanor Dunbar is a man with strong morals and values who has dedicated himself to being a one-woman player. There is no question he is the kind of man every woman dreams of in a soul mate. But Mychael D. is also the kind of man who can charm the fur off a mink in the dead of winter. Unfortunately, he is about to discover that his greatest talent is also his biggest curse.
Mychael D. has finally found lasting love with Tiffani. As he makes plans to marry the woman of his dreams, he has no idea that several of his past conquests are teaming up to win back his love. While the spurned women meet to exchange stories and formulate a plan, Mychael D. transforms into an advocate for domestic abuse victims. As he diligently places his energy into moving forward, Mychael D. becomes embroiled in a media frenzy that leads him on a surprising journey with unforeseen consequences.
His Bachelors Party shares a tale of passion and heartbreak as a man sets out on a quest to find love and discovers that nothing is easy, especially when it comes to leaving his past behind." />
