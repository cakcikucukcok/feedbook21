  <title>Confessions of Sexual Mania - Leslie Mae</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sunny Jim was the love child of doting parents. Exceptionally bright, he was twice promoted to a higher grade level. Among older, more sexually aware boys, he was teased for his ignorance of sex. Sunny made it his goal to learn more than the older  boys. At age nineteen, Sunny became employed by Ma Bell of Canada, choosing that job because of all the female telephone operators. On his first day at a suburban telephone station, the chief operator invited herself to be his weekend companion. The chief operator used Sunny for sexual experimentation, then tricked him into donating a dowry for her daughter wedding. Sunny married twice, but marriage didn keep him from seeking sex with other women. A special thrill for Sunny was the Christmas he spent with a countess who wanted him as her consort, an ex-sister-in-law who had issued an open invitation to share her bed, Sunny wife, and an orphan he had trained in sexual arts. Sunny invented a method of sending a cardiogram by telephone, but couldn have invented a stranger life than his own.  Though his love died with his  beloved Mindy, Sunny became the love of a homeless and unattractive woman life." />
