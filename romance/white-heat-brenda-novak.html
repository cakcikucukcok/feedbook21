  <title>White Heat - Brenda Novak</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A dangerous cult has recently taken over the desert ghost town of Paradise, Arizona. Members worship at the feet&amp;mdash;and in the bed&amp;mdash;of its charismatic leader, Ethan Wycliff, and obey his orders blindly. They&#39;ve already tried to murder one woman and they&#39;re implicated in the disappearance of another.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nate Ferrentino, who works for private security contractor Department 6, has been assigned to infiltrate this group. It&#39;s a challenge he welcomes&amp;mdash;until he learns that colleague Rachel Jessop will be going undercover &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; him. Thanks to their shared history, he&#39;d much rather go alone&amp;hellip;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The problem is, only married couples can participate in cult rituals. So, like it or not&amp;mdash;and they don&#39;t&amp;mdash;Rachel and Nate must pretend to be husband and wife.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There&#39;s no choice. Because if Wycliff &lt;em&gt;isn&#39;t&lt;/em&gt; exposed, if he &lt;em&gt;isn&#39;t&lt;/em&gt; stopped, more people will die. And Rachel might be one of them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
