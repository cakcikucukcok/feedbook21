  <title>What Would Jane Austen Do? - Laurie Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When a modern woman goes back to Jane Austen&#39;s time, she needs to know&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Everything! Eleanor agrees to travel back in time to prevent a deadly duel, but she doesn&#39;t know how to behave, what to say, and most importantly&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to tell a villain from a rake&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The captivating, infuriating, and mysterious Lord Shermont is a renowned rake and womanizerbut is he also a dangerous cutthroat and spy? Eleanor has to get up close and personal to find out&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Otherwise, she could fall into a most shocking scandal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thankfully, Miss Jane Austen herself arrives on the scene, with sage guidance and a twinkle in her eye, to help Eleanor navigate countryhouse society and the dangerous terrain of her own heart&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;From the author of &lt;em&gt;Hundreds of Years to Reform a Rake&lt;/em&gt;, a new time travel romance featuring a modern day career woman swept back in time to Regency England, where she thwarts a Napoleonic spy, chats with Jane Austen, and falls in love with a notorious rake.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;PRAISE FOR LAURIE BROWN:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Highly original. If you&#39;re in the market for a different kind of historical romance, or you enjoy stories filled with period detail, Hundreds of Years to Reform a Rake is a solid bet.&quot; &lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;wordcandybooks.blogspot.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Brown&#39;s ending was clever and I never suspected Josie would choose the path she takes. I would recommend Hundreds of Years to Reform a Rake to anyone who enjoys paranormals, and even Regency fans who don&#39;t usually read them. Brown did an excellent job of combining the two genres.&quot;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;aladysdiversions.blogspot.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;A very enjoyable read with Josie a feisty and independent character, and Deverell the ghost and Deverell the man both also very appealing.&quot; &lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;curledup.com&lt;/b&gt; &lt;p&gt; &quot;Humor, mystery, ghosts, history, and pure fun.&quot;&lt;br&gt; &lt;strong&gt;blogcritics.org &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;A fresh tale that is as charming as it is hot!&quot;&lt;br&gt; &lt;strong&gt;zeekspage.blogspot.com&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;You&#39;ll be transported to another time and won&#39;t want to return until the very last page is digested.&quot;&lt;br&gt; &lt;strong&gt;fantasybookspot.com&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When a modern woman goes back to Jane Austen&#39;s time, she needs to know&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Everything!
