  <title>The Stars Of Mithra: Hidden Star (Stars of Mithra) / Captive Star (Stars of Mithra) / Secret Star (Stars of Mithra) (Mills &amp; Boon e-Book Collections) - Nora Roberts</title>

        &lt;h2&gt;THE INTERNATIONAL BESTSELLING AUTHOR&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;‘The &lt;strong&gt;most successful novelist&lt;/strong&gt; on Planet Earth’ &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;HIDDEN STAR – She couldn’t remember a thing, not even who she was. But it was clear Bailey James was in trouble. Big trouble! And she desperately needed Cade Parris to help her live long enough to find out just what kind. The moment the coolheaded private eye laid eyes on the fragile beauty, she almost had him forgetting who he was. But what was she doing with a satchel full of cash and a diamond as big as a baby’s fist? And how could he unravel this mystery if he kept tripping over his heart?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;CAPTIVE STAR – All cynical bounty hunter Jack Dakota had to do was pick up some pretty little bail jumper. But soon discovered there was nothing easy about spitfire M. J. O’Leary—or about this case. Someone had set them both up. Now they were handcuffed together and on the run from a pair of killers. And M. J. wasn’t talking—not even when Jack found a gigantic blue diamond hidden in her bag. Everything told Jack this alluring vixen couldn’t be trusted… everything except his captive heart.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;SECRET STAR – He was standing face-to-face with a dead woman… Lieutenant Seth Buchanan’s homicide investigation—and his heart—were thrown into turmoil when Grace Fontaine turned up very much alive… and in possession of one of the diamonds known as the Stars of Mithra. The cool, controlled cop never let his feelings get in the way of his job, and everything he knew about the notorious heiress told him she was poison. But it was hard to remember there was any mystery more important to solve than that of Grace herself.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Nora Roberts is a publishing phenomenon; this New York Times bestselling author of over 200 novels has more than 450 million of her books in print worldwide.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;Praise for Nora Roberts&lt;/h2&gt;
