  <title>Turbulent Tunnel - Jenn Shell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Without any doubt, Lisa Diamond knows that she and her high school sweetheart, Johnny, share a true and eternal love. Life is a paradise filled with love, hope, and the promise of forever in Johnnys arms.&lt;p&gt;
But life has different plans for her heart and her future. Driven apart by circumstances and teenage pride, she marries Michael, the new love of her life at seventeen. Inspired by the hopeful new dreams of a new bride, she looks forward to forever at Michaels side.&lt;p&gt;
How quickly life can change. &lt;p&gt;
Due to a devastating car accident shortly after the wedding, Lisa now lingers in a nonresponsive vegetative state in a hospital bed. No one knows that within her motionless body, her mind still races in fear and pain, in love and longing, and between hope and hopelessness. Five years later, there is little reason for optimism. Lisas devoted husband, faced with his greatest, heartbreaking life challenge, ponders an impossible choice: &lt;p&gt;
Is it time to let her go?&lt;p&gt;
Trapped alone in the darkness, Lisa has only her memories for company. Johnny is never far from her heart, even as her husband is ironically never far from her side. 
Michael struggles with his own demons, doubts, and needs. His friend Annette refuses to be the reason to end his marriage, despite its current state. Life, as the grieving husband has come to learn, is complicated. Will heartbreak drive him to a decision he will forever regret? &lt;p&gt;
Only time will tell." />
