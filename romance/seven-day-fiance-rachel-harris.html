  <title>Seven Day Fiance - Rachel Harris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Angelle Prejean is in a pickle. Her family is expecting her to come home with a fiancé--a fiancé who doesn&#39;t exist. Well, he &lt;i&gt;exists&lt;/i&gt;, but he definitely has no idea Angelle told her mama they were engaged. Tattooed, muscled, and hotter than sin, Cane can reduce Angelle to a hot mess with one look--and leave her &lt;i&gt;heart&lt;/i&gt; a mess if she falls for him. But when she ends up winning him at a charity bachelor auction, she knows just how to solve her fiancé problem.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cane Robicheaux is no one&#39;s prince. He doesn&#39;t do relationships and he doesn&#39;t fall in love. When sweet, sultry-voiced Angelle propositions him, he hopes their little fiancé game can finally get her out of his head. He doesn&#39;t expect her to break through all his barriers. But even as Angelle burrows deeper into his heart, he knows once their seven days are up, so is their ruse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Love &amp; Games series is STANDALONE: &lt;br&gt;* Taste the Heat&lt;br&gt;* Seven Day Fiance&lt;br&gt;* Accidentally Married on Purpose&lt;/p&gt;" />
