  <title>Date with a Vampire - G. Ryan Love, Celeste W. Love</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Date with a Vampire
. . . . at a glance
Have you ever fallen in
love with someone from whom
everything in your soul tells you to flee? Shalay did. Join the journey
of Shalay as she falls for a vampire. Meet Sean McNeil, vampire, music
producer, and hopeless romantic slash gigolo. As the secrets from the past
unfold, living history walks and romances. Meet Tiffany and Toyoni and
Marlow, as they come along for the ride as Seans sinister past comes back
to hunt them. Sean has drawn his finger across the pages of history.
The past that Sean has tried to out run for two hundred years has come for
him again. No one is safe. No one knows what danger lurks in the shadows.
No one knows the kind of love that lurks in those dark corners either.
Meet Marvin, Seans friend and latest progeny. He, too has a past with
Shalay. See the conflict with him and his master as he tries to redeem the
memory of his late fiance, Shalays dead older sister. The uncle like bond
that has been in the past comes back to life as his womanizer friend tries
to settle down with his honorary niece. He however is somewhat aware
of Seans more nasty acquaintances and desperately tries to stop this sordid
love affair with the supernatural before its too late.
