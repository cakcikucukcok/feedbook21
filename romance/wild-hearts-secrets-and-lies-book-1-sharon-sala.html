          &lt;strong&gt;Past Sins Cast a Long Shadow &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Dallas Phillips refuses to believe her father committed suicide, even though things were tough on his farm and he was deeply in debt. When she hears he&#39;d told a neighbor about an upcoming windfall, she grows suspicious, and her suspicion only deepens when she realizes someone is lurking in the nearby mountains after dark.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For help, she turns to Trey Jakes, local police chief–and her former lover. As they begin to investigate, another mystery comes to light. Trey&#39;s mother is beginning to remember events from thirty years ago, something shadowy that happened in the mountains, and Dallas&#39;s father was there, too. Is what happened that night connected to his &quot;suicide&quot;? As they search for the truth, Trey and Dallas struggle to fight their attraction, but they may not be able to fend off another force–a killer who&#39;s more than willing to kill again to make sure old secrets stay buried.&lt;/p&gt;
