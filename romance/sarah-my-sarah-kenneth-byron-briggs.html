      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;After three tours of duty in Iraq, Davids career in the United States Army Rangers came to an abrupt end when he was almost killed fighting off an attack by a suicide bomber. When he returned home, he needed to find a place to try and forget the nightmare of the war. Thats when he met Sarah and fell in love. She felt the same way for him; a deep overpowering love. However, Sarah was caught in a web of abuse and manipulation that bound her so tightly that she had lost any hope of escape. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Dramatic story of romance and sacrifice, Sarah my Sarah reveals the overwhelming power of love over evil. This story also tells how a family was held tightly in the grip of a sociopathic Elder in the community. Each member was manipulated and controlled by their own personal nightmare; a brutal reality of physical and mental abuse. The sweet and beautiful power of love is the divine force that sets them all free.&lt;/p&gt;" />
