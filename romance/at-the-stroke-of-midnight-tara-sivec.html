  <title>At the Stroke of Midnight - Tara Sivec</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Meet the Naughty Princess Club: a brand new series from &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Tara Sivec that introduces readers to Fairytale Lane and the hilarity--and romance--that ensue when three women start a new business to make it rain.  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time Cynthia was the perfect housewife. Between being the President of the PTA and keeping her home spotless without a hair (or her pearls) out of place, her life was a dream come true. Her husband was once her knight in shining armor, but now he&#39;s run off with all their money...and the babysitter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dressed as a princess at the annual Halloween block party on Fairytale Lane, she meets two other &quot;princesses&quot; also facing money troubles: antique store owner Ariel and librarian Isabelle. When the women are invited to wear their costumes to a party where they&#39;re mistaken for strippers, Cindy, Ariel, and Belle realize that a career change could be the best way to make their money problems go &lt;i&gt;bippity-boppity-boo&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But can structured Cindy approach a stripper pole without sanitizing wipes? And could the blue-eyed anti-prince that has been crossing her path become Cindy&#39;s happily ever after? &lt;i&gt;At the Stroke of Midnight&lt;/i&gt; is a hilarious, empowering story where princesses can save themselves while slaying in stilettos.&lt;/p&gt;" />
