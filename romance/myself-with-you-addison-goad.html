  <title>Myself With You - Addison Goad</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Finding yourself is something that everyone struggles with but for Delilah Montgomery it felt like she was looking for something that didn&#39;t exist. She had a life full of people who loved her and still felt alone. She felt the need for adventure and to get lost somewhere on an empty highway. The problem with going to search for something is not knowing what to expect. Delilah is moving half way across the country to live with her best friend Scarlett. Adam had always been the type of guy who drank every night, played gigs, and slept with whichever girl went home with him that night. He was getting through life and enjoying every moment.  Adam wasn&#39;t looking to fall in love but when Scarlett&#39;s best friend moves to town he can&#39;t help but find her charm irresistible. With news from an old flame his life is turned upside down and he realizes that he must chose responsibility over Delilah. Suddenly he finds himself wishing that he had just stayed in all of those nights waiting for her to come into his life." />
