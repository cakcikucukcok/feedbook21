  <title>Honor Bound - Sandra Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“My name is Lucas Greywolf.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A raspy voice, as soft and sandy as the wind that blew across the desert, spoke directly into her ear.  It was a gentle sound, but Aislinn wasn’t deceived.  Like the winds it reminded her of, it could be whipped into a fury. . .&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aislinn Andrews knows his name because his escape from prison has prompted a statewide manhunt.  As lean and menacing as a panther, the fugitive invades her house, her bed, and then takes her as his hostage.  Overnight, Aislinn’s safe and predictable life is upended by a man considered criminal and dangerous.  However, his greatest threat to Aislinn isn’t the knife he wields, but his untame appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All his life, Lucas Greywolf has harbored a bitter grudge against Anglos, resenting even that half of his heritage.  Years spent in prison for a crime he didn’t commit hasn’t quelled his fighting spirit, but only fanned it.  After escaping, he comes face-to-face with blond, blue-eyed Aislinn Andrews, the epitome of everything he hates.  Yet he must have her.  Now the war Lucas wages is personal, and his fiercest enemy is his longing for the wrong woman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two people. Two worlds. One shared moment of incandescent passion…when nothing else mattered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But can that unifying instant withstand everything that divides them, when the largest obstacle they face is the most difficult to overcome? Pride.&lt;/p&gt;" />
