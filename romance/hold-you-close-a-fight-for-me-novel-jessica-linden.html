  <title>Hold You Close: A Fight For Me Novel - Jessica Linden</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Tony Adamo, billionaire heir to a massive corporation, has no interest in the money and prestige his title brings. What he does want? To stay sharp so the other MMA fighters don&#39;t pummel him in the ring, and to keep his unworthy father from sullying the name of the company his grandfather so lovingly built. But when he locks eyes with the woman he&#39;s never forgotten, Tony &lt;i&gt;needs&lt;/i&gt; her like he&#39;s never needed anything before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ginny Frazier hasn&#39;t seen Tony since the soul-shattering kiss they shared years ago. Ginny was always the good girl, the kind girl--but something about the hot as hell man with a smile to die for that her older sister brought home made her melt in a way no one ever had before. Despite their scorching kiss the night of her cruel sister&#39;s breakup with Tony, they never amounted to more. Until now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tony was stupid to let Ginny go, and now that she&#39;s back in his life, he plans to hold onto her forever. The one problem? Ginny is engaged to a powerful, deadly man--a man who holds a dark secret that could shatter the Frazier family if it ever came to light. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will Tony be able to keep from losing Ginny all over again? And can Ginny save her family, and still have true love?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Fight for Me Novel&lt;/p&gt;" />
