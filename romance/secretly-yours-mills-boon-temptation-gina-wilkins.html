        &lt;p&gt;Pilot Trent McBride had always been a little too brash, too cocky for his own good. But that was before his recklessness almost cost him his life. After a plane crash leaves him permanently grounded, he doesn&#39;t know–or care–what he&#39;s going to do with his life. Then he meets Annie…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Annie Stewart has come to Honoria to start over. After dumping one fiance, the last thing she&#39;s looking for is a man. Then again, she&#39;s never come across a man like gorgeous, grumpy Trent McBride before. Only, he won&#39;t give them a chance, insisting he&#39;s not the man she needs. But when Annie&#39;s past catches up with her, Trent&#39;s definitely the man she wants….&lt;/p&gt;
