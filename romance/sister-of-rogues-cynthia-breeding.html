Her only bit of good luck is that the asylum&#39;s overcrowded and she&#39;s assigned a room in a nearby castle. She knows the more she tries to convince her captors of the plot against her family, the more insane she sounds, but she finds a spark of hope in the young earl of the castle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With his family fortune dwindling, Earl Kier O&#39;Reilly pays his taxes by hosting non-violent asylum inmates in his ancestral castle. He knows that since Fiona is his ward, he should not be attracted to her, but the grey-eyed beauty has captured his heart, and he soon begins to doubt she&#39;s as mad as everyone says she is...which means there&#39;s a sinister plot afoot, and the lovely Fiona is in danger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each book in the Rogue series is a standalone story that can be enjoyed in any order. &lt;br&gt;Series Order:&lt;br&gt;    Book 1: Rogue of the Highlands&lt;br&gt;    Book 2: Rogue of the Isles&lt;br&gt;    Book 3: Rogue of the Borders&lt;br&gt;    Book 4: Sister of Rogues&lt;br&gt;    Book 5: Rogue of the High Seas&lt;br&gt;    Book 6: Rogue of the Moors&lt;/p&gt;" />
