  <title>Manna Tree - Savannah J. Frierson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A night of celebration ends in tragedy, shocking Cole Patterson to his core. Cole&amp;rsquo;s brother breaks his promise not to drink and drive, causing a fatal accident. Cole greets the victims&amp;rsquo; family, shouldering his brother&amp;rsquo;s guilt since he was no longer there to do it himself. Yet when he sees Margot Reed, something other than grief and guilt fills his soul.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; If Margot never sees the inside of a hospital emergency room again, it will be too soon. Barely registering the haggard, yet expensively tailored man trying to give his condolences, she nearly collapses under the weight of her sorrow at losing her family in one fell swoop. But Cole is there to support her that night, and he doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem inclined to ever stop. Margot can&amp;rsquo;t bring herself to mind.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Brought together by mutual sadness, Cole and Margot forge a friendship where the possibility of love and loss looms on the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;" />
