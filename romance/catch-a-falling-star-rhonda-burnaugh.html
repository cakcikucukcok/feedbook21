  <title>Catch a Falling Star - Rhonda Burnaugh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Catch a Falling Star begins in Marysville, California with the return of the prodigal town hero, pop star Michael Dolanski, who is attempting to conceal a medical condition from amorous fans.  Roman Catholic priest, Joseph di Blasio is a troubled man who has chosen his vocation for all the wrong reasons and meeting Michael does nothing but challenge his beliefs.  Complications arise when the girl who stole Michaels heart many years ago returns, and decides to find a way to rekindle their romance.   In the meantime, Joe finds himself in a new world that he never dared to imagine.   
As Joe and Michaels friendship evolves, they realize the profound effect they have on each others life.  But time is running out and they must face the moment of truth and find a way to make peace with whatever the future may hold.   
A love story for this generation, Catch a Falling Star is an emotional journey about surviving losses, trusting again and finding hope.   Throughout times of joy and sorrow, they each find that compassion is the glue that holds everything in the universe together, that we are all connected, and that wishes can come true, when you wish upon a falling star." />
