  <title>Second Circle Tattoos, The Complete Series - Scarlett Cole</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Meet the heroes of Second Circle Tattoos. Trent, Cujo, Dred, Reid. And now all four books from Scarlett Cole are together for the first time in a fabulous, low priced eBook bundle featuring an exclusive epilogue. Why pick one book boyfriend when you can have all four? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tattoo artist with a heart of gold.&lt;br&gt;The playboy with his own hidden scars.&lt;br&gt;The international rockstar who longs for a home.&lt;br&gt;The mechanic with a dark past. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Strongest Steel&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Harper Connelly never expected to find herself outside of a tattoo parlor at one in the morning. The scars that decorate her back are just one more reminder of things she&#39;d rather forget, the past she wants to leave far behind her, but before she can move on, she needs him. Trent Andrews has his own reasons for specializing in inking over scars. And there&#39;s no way in hell he&#39;s going to turn Harper away. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Fractured Heart&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tattoo artist Brody &quot;Cujo&quot; Matthews knows how to keep things simple. In life and in love. That all changes when he meets Drea Caron, the definition of high maintenance and sizzling curves. And the one woman he doesn&#39;t want to walk away from. Andrea &quot;Drea&quot; Caron is broke and tired. After years of caring for her ailing mom, she&#39;s at the end of her rope trying to manage the piling medical bills, two jobs, and a life placed on hold. She certainly doesn&#39;t need the added frustration of a sexy playboy tattoo artist messing up her carefully balanced life. Too bad the universe has other ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Purest Hook&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rugged, hot, and rock hard, Dred Zander is exactly the type of man that normally sends Pixie running. Not dreaming about running her hands down his washboard abs...and lower. The lead singer and guitarist for the band Preload embodies trouble behind his quick smile and guarded eyes, and Pixie left trouble behind her years ago along with the name Sarah Jane Travers and the pathetic trailer her mom called home. But Dred has other ideas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Darkest Link&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;When her car breaks down off the side of a lonely highway far from her sunny Miami home, tattoo artist Lia never expected her very own white knight to ride up on the back of a barely street-legal motorcycle...and she never expected to fall for her dark savior. A bruised heart Lia is not looking for forever, and the hot mechanic, with his sexy scruff and shaggy hair, is simply impossible to resist.&lt;/p&gt;" />
