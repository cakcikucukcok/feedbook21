          &lt;strong&gt;ON THIN ICE&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Ex-hockey pro Logan Dupree had sworn never to return to the ice. Forced to leave the game after a debilitating accident, he&#39;d spent his days battered and world-weary, trying to forget his former life. Until struggling single mom Catherine Talbott walked through his door begging him to coach her hockey team, and he couldn&#39;t resist the job–or his new boss.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Catherine was immediately drawn to Logan–his tall build, penetrating eyes and deep voice made her desperate to warm his chilled heart–both on and off the ice. WOrking so closely with him made it difficult to resist temptation, even though she knew he wasn&#39;t the type to settle down. But would seducing a man so reluctant to love bring heartbreak, or was Catherine exactly what Logan needed?&lt;/p&gt;
