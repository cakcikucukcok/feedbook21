  <title>The Boundless Deep - Kate Brallier</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Philosophers have said that we travel through our lives, past and present, surrounded by the same souls, that we spend each new life trying to mend the hurts we&#39;ve done to one another in the past. In &lt;i&gt;The Boundless Deep&lt;/i&gt;, Kate Brallier explores this idea in a combination of strong storytelling and gifted characterization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grad student Liza has long been plagued by vivid dreams of whaling. Offered the chance to trade her land-locked existence for a summer on Nantucket, the well-preserved heart of New England&#39;s whaling trade, Liza jumps at the chance, eager to see how well her dreams mesh with historical reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer is: all too well. Liza&#39;s dreams become highly sexual; her visions of ship&#39;s captain Obadiah Young grow increasingly intense. At times the past and present mix before her eyes, with automobiles replaced by horse-drawn carriages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though skeptical of Liza&#39;s claims of a past life, whaling museum curator Adam is drawn to Liza&#39;s intense desire to know the truth--about herself, and about Obadiah, accused of murdering his beautiful, young wife.  But Adam isn&#39;t the only man with an interest in Liza--handsome Lucian, whose home Liza is sharing for the season, has designs on her as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a single summer, Liza must answer the riddle of her dreams, reunite lovers separated by death, solve a hundred-year-old murder . . . and figure out her heart&#39;s desire.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
