  <title>Chasing a Dream - Catherine Carson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="From an early age Dorry Enfield chased the dream of being loved and cherished by Morgan Cummings.  Reaching the age of fourteen she came to terms with the fact the five year gap between them was always going to be a problem and accepted he would never see her as a desirable woman. With interference from their respective grandfathers, ten years down the line, they were brought together in the hopes they would marry and so consolidate two family businesses linked by the travel industry and hopefully, love. Morgan was adamant their grandfather&#39;s plan would never work but after a very vivid erotic dream he found himself trying to come to terms with a situation he never thought to find himself in. Can two people chase the same dream and come to the same conclusion.....?" />
