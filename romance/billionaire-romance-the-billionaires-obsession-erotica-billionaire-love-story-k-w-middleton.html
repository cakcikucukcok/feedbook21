      <meta name="description" content="She loves his sophistication, his brilliance and his charisma, but she is still intimidated by his secret and what he seems to keep from her. On one hand, he seems to lead a secret life apart from her and on the other side he shares the most passionate moments that she has ever experienced each time when they are reunited. They rekindle their hot sensual affair in the most sensual lustful moments and places. He seems to want her on his own terms and his way of doing things. He seems to have set up a plan for her and while he wrestles with his inner dark secrets, Mandy is forced to make the most important decision of her life. Finally, Mandy decides to break up their relationship for good and she desires to start a new life as a serious and dedicated Academy student. Mandy has to come up with the toughest decision of her life in order to save her and her baby&#39;s future. She never wants to see or hear from the Wall Street Billionaire ever again, but the desire for him still dominates her every waking second. For the sake of her unborn baby, Mandy can not go with what he suggests or forces her to do. She realizes by now that she has been ignoring the fact that he is willing to cross all limits. He does not play by the rules of fairness. Instead, he chooses to cross the law. During her relationship she has been ignoring that his philosophy is to take back what he owns if sweet seduction is simply not getting him what he desires. She also has been ignoring that his desire is powered by his darkest fears because when you&#39;re fighting a past that seems to know all your secrets there will come a day when fair game is no longer an option...
