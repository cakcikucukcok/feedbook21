  <title>The Journal - Grace Richardson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Caroline Porter was a beautiful young woman who lived in an average town during the early 1880s. Her life, on the other hand, was anything but ordinary.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Over one hundred years later, Kathleen Robertson is a successful bank executive whose life gets turned upside down when a handsome stranger gives her Carolines antique journal to read.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;From the first page, the journal comes alive as Kathleen finds herself enraptured with the details of Caroline Porters life. She reads about Carolines courtship with a cold-hearted man; the strong, undeniable pull she feels toward his younger brother; and her unintentional involvement in a murder mystery. As she reads, Kathleens belief that unexpected miracles can happen when you follow the Lords leading is reaffirmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come along as the lives of these two strong Christian women intertwine. For Kathleen, life will never be the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A beautifully written series. I was so involved with the characters, I felt like I knew them personally, devouring each line and page until the very exciting end!&lt;br /&gt; 
Janet R., Newfane, New York&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;an intricate saga with fascinating characters. The subplots are woven like a fine tapestrya definite page turner.&lt;br /&gt;
Sharon S., Middleport, New York&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;engrossingan excellent read. I couldnt put the series down. I would recommend these books to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;
