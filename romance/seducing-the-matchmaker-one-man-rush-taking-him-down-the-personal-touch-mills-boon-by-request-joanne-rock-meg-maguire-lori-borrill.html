  <title>Seducing The Matchmaker: One Man Rush / Taking Him Down / The Personal Touch (Mills &amp; Boon By Request) - Joanne Rock, Meg Maguire, Lori Borrill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One Man Rush&lt;/strong&gt; by Joanne Rock&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Matchmaker Marissa Collins is looking for a man. A hot, successful, man. But the man she&#39;s considering – hockey player Kyle Murphy – is for a prospective client. Marissa’s matchmaking professionalism goes MIA, though, when she meets Kyle…who&#39;s not coming along quietly.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Kyle isn’t looking for a match. He has his eye on the prize – the Stanley Cup – or at least he did before Marissa dropped into his life. Now he’s playing a new game, one where getting Marissa in bed is the goal. And if he has to play dirty…that&#39;s even better.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taking Him Down&lt;/strong&gt; by Meg Maguire&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;No unsportsmanlike conduct&lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Matchmaker Lindsey Tuttle always thought Rich Estrada was a whole lot of sexy. What’s not to lust after? He’s a gorgeous, flirty Mixed Martial Arts fighter. When they find themselves heating up during an unexpected – and super-intense – make-out session, Lindsey is ready … until Rich ends it with no explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;Three rounds…&lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Now it’s almost a year later, and Rich has a broken foot, which means a frustrating recovery back in Boston before his next fight. But this could be the perfect time for a rematch with a sexy little matchmaker…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;And minimal clothing!&lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;There’s no denying the chemistry between them. It’s full-contact, no-holds-barred attraction… and only &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; can be on top!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Personal Touch&lt;/strong&gt; by Lori Borrill&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When matchmaker Margot Roth is hired to find a date for the mother of a playboy millionaire, an erotic fling is the last thing on her mind. Well, maybe not the last thing. Clint Hilton is the sexiest man she&#39;s ever met, and she has to admit naughty things go through her mind when he looks at her with his sultry eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But now that Clint is there to turn her fantasies into reality, Margot isn&#39;t sure if giving in to temptation is the best idea–even if he&#39;s determined to share his bed with her…or something more.&lt;/p&gt;
