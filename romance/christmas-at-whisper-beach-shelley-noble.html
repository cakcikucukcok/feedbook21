  <title>Christmas at Whisper Beach - Shelley Noble</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The holidays always seem brighter at Whisper Beach&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Van Moran is ready for happily ever after, even if she&amp;#8217;s not quite convinced she can get it. After finally opening a second branch of her company in Whisper Beach, she&amp;#8217;s enjoying her new romance with Joe Enthorpe, the local vineyard owner. She may never have a traditional family, but she won&amp;#8217;t let that stop her from having a joyful Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joe is ready to spend a very merry Christmas with Van and his always rambunctious family. But when the mother of a local boy becomes tragically ill, Joe invites him and his sisters to stay at the vineyard. Everything soon begins to unravel as Joe fears the complications will drive Van away and he&amp;#8217;s desperate to keep their relationship from crumbling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But with every Christmas comes a miracle and soon, Van and Joe learn that it isn&amp;#8217;t always about the family you make, but the one that lives in your heart.&lt;/p&gt;" />
