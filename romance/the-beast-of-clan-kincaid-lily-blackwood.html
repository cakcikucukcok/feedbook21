  <title>The Beast of Clan Kincaid - Lily Blackwood</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Highland warrior battles to reclaim his birthright in the first of a new series filled with seduction, revenge, and soul-stirring passion...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  They call him the Beast--a hardened mercenary whose heart seems as cold as his icy blue gaze. They do not know his true name: Niall Braewick, son of the Laird of Kincaid. It has been years since he escaped into the forest the night his father was murdered. Now he has returned, ablaze with a vengeful hunger. He will gain the MacClaren chief&#39;s trust, gather his clan, and take back his lands. And take the MacClaren&#39;s daughter as well...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Though he pulled her from the river, saving her life, Elspeth has been warned to keep her distance from her father&#39;s hired warrior. He is a barbarian--a shame, as he is far more compelling than the lechers and fools competing for her dowry. Little does she know that, like the castle itself, she is a prize Niall intends to claim...but will he extract blood for blood and possess what is his, or will his enemy&#39;s beautiful, innocent daughter tempt him to forsake his dream of conquest?&lt;/p&gt;" />
