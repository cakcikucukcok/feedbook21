  <title>Katie His Mechanic - Cd Von Bruton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Kate OConnell, supermodel-business woman lives her life in the spotlight.  Kate accepts her fame with graciousness and lives her life to the fullest.  In her line of work, she finds herself in constant demand, both on the job and socially.  Her face and her social life are often the headline stories in magazines and tabloids world-wide.  Her fame and fortune has taught her to make staying uninvolved and emotionally detached her number one rule. Then she met Ben Morrison.  He walked into her life bringing hot desire and a lot of complications with him.  Kate cant get him off her mind.  She has more than one steamy dream where Ben plays the starring roll!
     Business Management Consultant, Ben Morrison meets the vibrant and beautiful Kate OConnell in her father and brothers garage when his car has mechanical problems on his way to a business meeting in Richmond, Virginia.  Kate tinkers with Bens car, fixing the problem and leaving him with the erroneous idea that shes a small town girl whos a competent mechanic.  Hes aroused and intrigued by the girl and cant wait to see her again.
     When Kate calls him, a few weeks later from London, hes overwhelmed to find out that she was home on vacation and is in reality the co-owner of the world famous Model World in London and that theres an ocean between his desire and the girl of his dreams." />
