  <title>The Sea King&#39;s Lady - S.E. Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A world filled with dragons, merpeople, pirates, witches, monsters, Elementals, adorably mischievous boys plotting to complete their family, and gorgeous, lonely kings surrounded by secrets...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jenny Ackerly can&amp;rsquo;t bring herself to give up the search for her best friend Carly, not yet. She would know - she would! - if Carly was dead. Though today marks exactly two years since Carly disappeared without a trace from Yachats State Park and Jenny knows she should be moving on, still she feels compelled to go one last time to the Park....&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Orion is the powerful ruler of the Isle of the Sea Serpent and protector of the oceans &amp;ndash; and never in his life has he felt so helpless. For hundreds of years, the Eyes of the Sea Serpent have been in his family&amp;rsquo;s possession, giving them power over the oceans, and now they have been stolen! Meanwhile, his oldest son&amp;rsquo;s bargain with the Sea Witch threatens to seal the fate of the merpeople&amp;mdash;possibly the fate of all the Seven Kingdoms, because Orion&amp;#39;s people will surely be needed in the coming war. The situation seems bleak... until a fiery female from another world appears.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
An unlikely alliance between Jenny and Orion could change everything, but what will it take survive the evil lurking in the depths of the ocean?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Internationally acclaimed S.E. Smith presents a new action-packed story full of romance and adventure. Brimming with her signature humor, vivid scenes, and beloved characters, this book is sure to be another fan favorite!&lt;br /&gt;
