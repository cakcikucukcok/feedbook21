        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Daisy Spencer&#39;s name is on everybody&#39;s lips…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;How could the sensible daughter of Trinity Harbor&#39;s self-proclaimed patriarch have taken in the boy caught hot-wiring her car? Whether the boy is a modern-day Huck Finn or not, Trinity Harbor is in an uproar. But for Daisy, guiding the orphaned ten-year-old is easy, an escape from her own tragic past. She can ignore the town&#39;s nay-saying. The only real obstacle is…that man.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That man&lt;/em&gt; is the boy&#39;s uncle, Walker Ames, a tough D.C. cop who sees his unexpected nephew as his last chance at redemption. Soon he&#39;s commuting to the charming fishbowl of a town, where everyone assumes he&#39;s seduced Daisy–their &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt; Sunday-school teacher! But to Walker, Daisy is a disconcerting mix of charming innocence and smart-mouthed excitement in a town that&#39;s not as sleepy as it looks.&lt;/p&gt;
