She&#39;s been that way since she lost her virginity to a young man from Texas named Bobby Henson, but that&#39;s not the only thing that excites her. When the streets of the city go dark, she prowls the night, the rush arousing, sensual, making her body respond in ways that she&#39;d rather not say. Dale brushes cold gun steel against her deep cleavage and her juices start to flow, she&#39;s hunting. Hunting things that can&#39;t be explained not knowing that there are those who are watching. Some with interest in her power, others wanting to posses her body, soul.  Dale takes a journey down a dark path leading to demons, gods, bondage and submission, pain and ecstasy, love and sacrifice. Will she resist the forces that desire her or will she succumb to their sexual deviance?" />
