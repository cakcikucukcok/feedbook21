      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;THE ENGAGEMENT ASSIGNMENT&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;While investigating a dangerous drug ring, Detective Chloe Brant witnesses a hostage situation…and gets pulled into a case that could make her career. But to bring down rival drug-dealing gangs, she has to pose as the fiancée of Detective Trent Henry—the man who broke her heart the last time they were undercover together. Trent&#39;s been undercover so long, he can’t let anything blow this case…even his growing feelings for his temporary fiancée. But when he comes face to face with his past, a killer makes Chloe his target. And for the first time, the danger of his job is personal…because if he wants his pretend romance to become real, he and Chloe must stay alive.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;TRUE NORTH HEROES: For these Canadian bachelor brothers, all roads lead to danger.&lt;/p&gt;
