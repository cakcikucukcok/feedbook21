  <title>Red Aura - Kathryn Dorbeck</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dr. Suzanne Jacobsen seems to be on the right track in life. She loves her job and her boyfriend, Steven. But when she catches a glimpse of a mysterious man in the operating room, who disappears as quickly as he appears, Suzanne&#39;s life takes a different turn. Left wondering if she is hallucinating, Suzanne encounters the mysterious man again outside of the operating room. With her brief encounter yielding no more insight into this man, she decides to focus on her own life that seems to be quickly unraveling. As her mysterious man continues to appear, Suzanne is drawn to his magnetism, even as she contemplates whether he is an angel or a demon. While haunting dreams plague her, Suzanne enlists the help of her sister to piece together an intriguing puzzle, all while trying to reason with her own heart. Red Aura is a compelling story of self-discovery, heartbreak, love, and finding new beginnings as Suzanne uncovers her destiny." />
