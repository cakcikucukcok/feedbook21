  <title>The Hometown - Leena Ceraveeni</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Mala Thomas, a 23-year-old Indian American, wants a big, multicultural city to escape her dead-end job and racial experiences in Indiana. She packs up her Acura Vigor and makes an impulsive move to Houston, Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;In Houston, she doesnt get questioned about being Indian. The South is very different from the Midwest and Mala cant take the word yall seriously. On her career path, she lands a job in the energy industry and falls for work-obsessed Cyril, a Creole who works in her office building.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The death of the sister she cant remember, her love for 80s rock, and her past racial experiences follow her everywhere she goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;What would happen if you were a discontented, twentysomething Indian-American girl, living in a boring Midwestern city and working a dead-end job, still a virgin, living at home with parents you think should divorce, and suddenly decide to pack up and move to Houston, Texas? Read The Hometown and find out! Along the way you&#39;ll be entertained and enlightened by this smart and witty coming-of-age novel that gets to the heart of &#39;growing up multicultural&#39; and making your way as a minority woman in America today.&quot; &lt;b&gt;- Jim Barnes, Editor, IndependentPublisher.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Finding a new home can lead to many unusual situations. &quot;The Hometown&quot; is a novel following Mala Thomas as she embraces a new spin of life in Houston, Texas and facing life as an Indian-American in the south. A story of career life and finding love, &quot;The Hometown&quot; is worth considering for general fiction collections.&quot;&lt;b&gt; - Midwest Book Review&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Author Leena Ceraveenis debut novel, The Hometown, examines the journey of a 23-year-old Indian American woman and her search for love, success, and something beyond the ordinary. The novel provides a witty and colorful illustration of what its like for an Indian American woman to beat the odds and embrace the unexpected.&quot;&lt;b&gt; - India West&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
