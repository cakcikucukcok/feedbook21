  <title>The Last Days of Pompeii - Edward Bulwer-Lytton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Edward Bulwer-Lytton (1803-1873) was a prolific novelist, poet and playwright in his day; in modern times, his work is considered much as Lovecraft described: &amp;ldquo;large doses of turgid rhetoric and empty romanticism.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;The Last Days of Pompeii&amp;quot; itself was probably the first novelization of the catastrophic event. &amp;nbsp;The city was rediscovered in the mid-1700s and archaeological excavations followed soon after. &amp;nbsp;Bulwer-Lytton was inspired to write his novel by the painting &lt;i&gt;The Last Day of Pompeii&lt;/i&gt; by Karl Briullov, painted in the early 1830s.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The novel itself tells the story of the Athenian Glaucus, his love, the beautiful Ione, and a blind flower-girl Nydia, who is secretly in love with Glaucus. &amp;nbsp;Threatening the love of Glaucus and Ione is Ione&amp;rsquo;s guardian, the decadent and deceitful Egyptian Arbaces, who lusts after Ione himself.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The descriptions of the city itself are fascinating: Bulwer-Lytton seems to have spent much time researching the actual ruins of Pompeii, and his characters are housed in buildings that had apparently been uncovered in archaeological excavations.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;The Last Days of Pompeii&amp;quot; was one of the most popular English historical novels of the nineteenth century." />
