          &lt;strong&gt;Winning this battle could mean losing it all&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;San Diego workaholic Emily Hollings doesn&#39;t eat fish, doesn&#39;t wear flannel shirts and certainly doesn&#39;t fraternize with the enemy. So why is she finding herself charmed by Rankins, Alaska—her company&#39;s next development target—and the leader of its hostile opposition, Bering James?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;She must be more burned-out than she thought. Her professional reserve is slipping. And she&#39;s starting to fantasize about a life beyond work…a life like Bering has here. Maybe they can put their professional differences aside and explore this…friendship. Or maybe she&#39;s just deluding herself. Because one of them has to win.&lt;/p&gt;
