&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
From &amp;quot;Our Lusty Cheating Neighbor&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sandy&amp;#39;s eyes darted between Stephanie and myself, seemingly trying to judge our mood. &amp;quot;Sure,&amp;quot; she said at last.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The door firmly shut behind us, hiding us from prying eyes. Sandy didn&amp;#39;t offer us any refreshment. Point for her, I thought. Don&amp;#39;t make it look like you&amp;#39;re happy to see us. Make us work for it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If Steph was fazed by Sandy&amp;#39;s unwelcoming attitude, she didn&amp;#39;t show it. She leaned back against a doorframe, her arms folded across her chest. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;d like to talk to you,&amp;quot; she said softly, &amp;quot;about what you have been doing with John.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Have you ever seen a pair of carnivores face off? You don&amp;#39;t see it often, because why should lions and tigers and bears go after something with big-ass teeth and claws when there is smaller, easier prey about?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sandy should have had the upper hand. This was her home, after all. She was on her own turf. And by any standard measurement, she was the more attractive woman. She was taller, with longer legs, larger breasts, and her golden skin and honey-blond hair made her look like every teenage boys&amp;#39; sex-fantasy come to life. It didn&amp;#39;t hurt that she was wearing something that belonged in a hair-metal music video&amp;nbsp; a crop-top t-shirt that clung to her chest as if molded, and a pair of bikini-cut panties that rode high on her hips and barely covered her crotch.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But as the stand-off went on, something became apparent to me. My wife - smaller, dark-haired, with a more modest chest and dressed in her casual business attire, had the more commanding presence. She was a sleek, black-haired panther, and as Sandy and her engaged in their battle of wills, it was the taller woman who dropped her eyes, the same way a lovely, cheerful golden retriever would roll over for her human at the slightest excuse.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sandy looked away, and I knew Steph had won. &amp;quot;Please,&amp;quot; she said, her voice cracking. &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t tell Mis...don&amp;#39;t tell Monica.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Monica?&amp;quot; I frowned. &amp;quot;What does she have to do with anything?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sandra blew out her breath. &amp;quot;Mis...Monica was the first.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;The first what?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;The first hotwife. For Paradise Place. She did then what I am doing now. For years and years. And then there was another woman. And now there&amp;#39;s me,&amp;quot; she said proudly. &amp;quot;Monica chose me.&amp;quot; She sniffled suddenly. &amp;quot;But if I don&amp;#39;t convince you to go to bed with me, she might replace me. Or...or she might not punish me.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I frowned. &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t you mean she will punish you?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;John,&amp;quot; Steph said. &amp;quot;Let me handle this.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She took a sliding step closer to the taller woman. &amp;quot;Tell me, Sandy,&amp;quot; she said, her voice soft. &amp;quot;How does she punish you? Mistress Monica?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I blinked, finally putting together the clues. Monica a dominant? And Sandy her submissive?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Oh, Stephanie.&amp;quot; Sandy shivered happily, her eyes gleaming. &amp;quot;She does such wonderful things to me. If I&amp;#39;m very, very good, she will spank me, paddling my bottom until it&amp;#39;s hot and pink..." />
