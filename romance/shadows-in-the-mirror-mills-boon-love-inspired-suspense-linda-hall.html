But learning anything about her past was proving impossible. Why were there no records of the accident that claimed her parents&#39; lives? No records of her parents, period? And who was trying to stop her from fi nding out? Someone whose threats were escalating. Someone close to her, such as Evan Baxter, the handsome photographer she&#39;d entrusted with the one clue she had.&lt;/p&gt;
