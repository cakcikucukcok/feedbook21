  <title>The Marrying Game - Kate Saunders</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Marrying Game&lt;/i&gt; opens on Christmas Eve, with four sisters at home worrying about money.  The setting is present-day England, and the girls&#39; father, an eccentric aristocrat, has just died, leaving the Hasty family so impoverished that they are about to lose their splendid but crumbling house. So the two oldest sisters--Rufa, tall, elegant, and too serious for her own good; and Nancy, a gorgeous, irreverent redhead who relishes her work as a part-time barmaid in the local pub--decide that the way to redeem the family fortunes is to marry money. Surely it can&#39;t be that hard to find two very rich men and make the men fall in love with them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus begins a gloriously modern story that makes us genuinely care about the whole Hasty family. As Rufa and Nancy set out to blaze a trail through London society, they find that nothing in The Marrying Game turns out quite the way they&#39;ve planned.&lt;/p&gt;" />
