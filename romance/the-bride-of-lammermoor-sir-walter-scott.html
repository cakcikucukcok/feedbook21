  <title>The Bride of Lammermoor - Sir Walter Scott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Edgar, the brooding young master of Ravenswood, retains none of his ancestral estates but a crumbling castle. Embittered by the lawsuits that have stripped him of his patrimony and shortened his despairing father&#39;s life, he determines to confront Sir William Ashton, the lawyer whose machinations led to the decline of Ravenswood&#39;s fortunes. But Edgar&#39;s plans take an abrupt turn upon meeting Sir William&#39;s lovely daughter, Lucy, and a romance blossoms against the tumultuous backdrop of the two warring families.&lt;BR&gt;Sir Walter Scott&#39;s immensely popular Waverly novels enthralled readers with their dashing mix of historical fiction, romance, and revenge. This installment, originally published in 1819, takes place in the early 1700s amid Scotland&#39;s Lammermuir Hills. Edgar and Lucy&#39;s troubled relationship &amp;#8212; beset by social, political, and religious barriers &amp;#8212; reflects Scotland&#39;s struggles in the early 18th century, as the country and its citizens were torn asunder by the Jacobite rebellions. Scott&#39;s treatment of the lovers&#39; inexorable destiny unfolds in a gothic atmosphere, punctuated by supernatural elements and symbolic imagery. The inspiration for Donizetti&#39;s opera &lt;I&gt;Lucia di Lammermoor, &lt;/I&gt;this novel remains a compelling example of its author&#39;s ability to transmute the effects of historical change into literary art. &lt;BR&gt;" />
