  <title>The Heiress of Newfield - Tina Appleton Bishop</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The plot for Tina Appleton Bishops second suspense novel, The Heiress of Newfield, combines romance, ambition, deceit and murder. Set in a prosperous farming town in Connecticut, teenage sisters, Alberta and Fredrika Eliot, become heiresses after their fathers death. A few years later when Janine Nelson, a woman of dubious past, moves into their historic farmhouse to help them in their business, the story takes an ominous turn. The tension in the story builds as Janine gradually extends her evil power. The tale is set in a period between the 1960s and the early 90s and is filled with a menu of unpredictable characters and incidents. &lt;p&gt;
Tina Appleton Bishops first paragraph hooked me. She creates a world that her characters inhabit so comfortably and fully, yet she has thrown such juicy emotional challenges their way  enough to keep me reading The Heiress of Newfield at one sitting. As one unexpected event turned into another, I could hardly contain my curiosity over what was to come.&lt;p&gt;
 Arlene Mark, childrens author&lt;p&gt;
Fredrika Eliot is the engaging heroine of The Heiress of Newfield. Entitled and impulsive, she has everyone guessing what she will do next in the quiet little Connecticut town. The author keeps her readers turning the pages to follow the 25-year adventures of this resilient and likable heiress.&quot;&lt;p&gt;
 Judy Richter, author, Some Favorite Days&lt;p&gt;
Born into a family of publishers, Tina Appleton Bishop is a fourth-generation New Yorker who has spent more than 60 of her 92 years in her adopted state of Connecticut. Long a writer and editor in Greenwich, she began her work as a first-time novelist at the age of 91 with the publication of Fishermans Creek in 2008. Her second suspense tale, The Heiress of Newfield, was completed a year later." />
