  <title>Desert Roses - Emma Anne Garrett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Its a time of movement in America. A time when the lure of free land, freedom from persecution, adventure, and open spaces calls them ever westward. Maliya Kerns father brought his family to the New Mexico Territory, but he didnt have the strength, wisdom or courage it would take to make it in what he considered an inhospitable land. His daughter did.  &lt;P&gt;	Green eyed Maliya, born to poverty and want was destined to heart ache, loss, pain and loneliness beyond endurance. Would she find the love she so desperately longed for, and a family of her own? Would the dogma of religion keep her from peace and safety?  This is a story of a young girls journey into womanhood in a time when life was harsh at best. And yet the goodness she gave to those around her would one day be returned in abundance.&lt;/P&gt;" />
