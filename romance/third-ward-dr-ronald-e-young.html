  <title>Third Ward - Dr.Ronald E. Young</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In a place where the police rarely enter, nothing pleases the youngest of the boys, Lawrence Ray, who nurtures an overly challenging and aggressive personality. Jessie James, who would rather eat than sleep, is on a track to be just as bad as the famous outlaw whose name he shares. Together, the two friends cannot seem to stay out of trouble. But when Little Man and Lawrence Rays mother takes their sisters and leaves them with their abusive father, Lawrence Ray disappears without a trace. Only one person knows where he is, and now Little Man must try to find him. It is just another day on Division Street in &lt;i&gt;Third Ward&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this vivid, heartfelt story, Little Man embarks on a coming-of-age journey as he attempts to succeed despite the seemingly insurmountable obstacles that stand before him in his tough Texas neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;" />
