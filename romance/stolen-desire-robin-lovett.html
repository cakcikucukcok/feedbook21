  <title>Stolen Desire - Robin Lovett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Koviye&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;My people call me the Sex God, but I, Koviye of the Fellamana, am so much more. I read their every desire and satisfy them with a mere touch of my hands. I&#39;m sworn to share my powers, and this thing humans call monogamy is biologically impossible for me, or so I thought until I met the human, Jenie, Lieutenant General in the rebellion against our mutual enemy determined to destroy us. Now, as though Jenie has some power over me, I cannot think of touching anyone but her.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jenie&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;ve dreamt of Koviye every night since I landed on this sex planet where every breath I take is an aphrodisiac to my blood. I am not fully human, I am part alien, and the planet has awakened my body&#39;s instinct to find a mate. The next person I have sex with I will form an attachment for life, which is impossible for the Sex God. I have a rebellion to lead. Mating a polyamorous alien would ruin me. I can never have him, no matter how much I burn for him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I need his help. My best friend was taken prisoner by our enemies, the Ten Systems, and the only person with a ship fast enough to save her is Koviye. And all those dreams I&#39;ve been having about him aren&#39;t just dreams, he tells me. They&#39;re real. He can dream walk, so if I can&#39;t have him while I&#39;m awake, at least I can have him in my dreams--as if that will ever be enough. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each book in the Planet of Desire series is STANDALONE:&lt;br&gt;* Toxic Desire&lt;br&gt;* Captive Desire&lt;br&gt;* Stolen Desire&lt;/p&gt;" />
