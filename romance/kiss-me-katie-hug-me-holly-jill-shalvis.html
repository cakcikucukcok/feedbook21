  <title>Kiss Me, Katie! &amp; Hug Me, Holly! - Jill Shalvis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kiss Me, Katie!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;All Katie Wilkins wanted for Christmas was to get Santa Claus under the mistletoe, because beneath that Santa suit was her ideal man--or so she thought. But it wasn&#39;t nice, safe Mr. Perfect who kissed her senseless. &lt;i&gt;Horrors!&lt;/i&gt; It was Bryan Morgan--wild man, stunt pilot and all-around daredevil. And, heaven help her, she&#39;d &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; liked that kiss. Which just proved what she&#39;d known all along--she was Christmas cursed!&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hug Me, Holly!&lt;/b&gt;Sheriff Riley McMann couldn&#39;t believe his ears when Holly Stone announced that she&#39;d be taking over the only café in Little Paradise. She looked as if she hadn&#39;t worked a day in her life, and besides, he had to eat there! But he was soon working up quite an appetite for &quot;Calamity Holly&quot; when he discovered there was more to her than designer clothes and an attitude. Maybe his Christmas wishes were going to come true after all..." />
