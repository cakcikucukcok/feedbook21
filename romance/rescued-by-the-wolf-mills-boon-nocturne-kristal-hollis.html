  <title>Rescued By The Wolf (Mills &amp; Boon Nocturne) - Kristal Hollis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;h2&gt;She&#39;s not afraid to run with this wolf.&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When a poacher killed his mate, Rafe Wyatt lost his future. While the Wahyas of Walker&#39;s Run have been pulling him back from the brink, he&#39;s certain he won&#39;t have another chance at love. That is, until Grace comes to town.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Grace Olsen is a woman without roots. That&#39;s exactly how she likes it, until a sojourn in a small, close-knit Appalachian community gives her a new vision of what home could be—and so does Rafe. He was supposed to be nothing more than a casual lover, just as wary of commitment as she is. When their raw attraction becomes something deeper, more complex, they could be looking at a new future together. But someone close to them both would rather see Grace dead than let her be with the man—and the wolf—she&#39;s grown to love.&lt;/p&gt;
