  <title>Sweet Disgrace - Cherrie Lynn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Centuries of heartbreak. Grinding failures punctuated by too-few victories. What angel in her right mind would want this job? Celeste, who&#39;s driven to save Devil-contracted souls before Hell can claim them, is weary but not beaten. Yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her latest case makes her wonder if it&#39;s all worth the anguish. A demon enticed a too- young musician into selling his soul for fortune and fame. To make matters worse, that demon is Damael, an insufferable, frightening minion with airtight contracts--and a body that makes her long for sin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Damael&#39;s always had a soft spot for Celeste, but if his bored superiors want drama, he&#39;ll give them drama. Though it pains him to trick the angel he wants with all his black heart, eons of restrained lust win out. He makes the deal: her body in exchange for the human&#39;s soul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She wasn&#39;t supposed to accept.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Damael can&#39;t be trusted, but with the deadline bearing down, Celeste lays everything on the line in a last-ditch effort to save just one precious soul. Even if it means losing hers--along with her heart.&lt;/p&gt;" />
