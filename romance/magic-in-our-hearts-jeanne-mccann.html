  <title>Magic in Our Hearts - Jeanne McCann</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Brett, a charismatic world-class skier with a playgirl lifestyle   Taylor, a talented and successful physical therapist  &lt;/p&gt;
One chance meeting and the two women fall head over heels for each other. Passion and the beginning of true love sweep the two off of their feet, but their relationship is ended almost before it has a chance to begin.&lt;/p&gt;
The two are reunited years later, after Brett&#39;s Olympic dreams are shattered along with her body. Battered and broken, relying on alcohol to numb her mind and heart, Brett is slowly killing herself.&lt;/p&gt;
Unable to refuse Brett&#39;s dying mother&#39;s request, Taylor agrees to work with Brett to help her regain some of her physical capabilities. Can Taylor overcome her heartbreak and anger long enough to help Brett heal? Will she be able to reach the woman she once knew and help her rekindle the passion that once made her a world-renowned skier? Will Brett have the fortitude to heal her mind and body? Both struggle with past feelings, deeply hidden hurts, anger and resurfacing emotions for each other. Working out their problems requires effort, love, and a little bit of magic.&lt;/P&gt;" />
