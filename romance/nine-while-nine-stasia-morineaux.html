  <title>Nine While Nine - Stasia Morineaux</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Isabeau Finne&amp;rsquo;s perfect world utterly unravels when she meets Death&amp;#39;s right-hand man one fateful night, spiraling her life into a world of chaos and the impossible...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Suddenly, she is no longer Isabeau and becomes part of the most secretive inner-workings of Death itself, as well as an otherworldly dominion of ancient magic.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now beings&amp;mdash;which we were taught as children were merely fictional creations of wildly whimsical minds&amp;mdash;are edging their way into her world as well.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Buggans and Kobolds and Vargs&amp;hellip;oh my!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She yearns for the simplicity of her old life&amp;mdash;this one is full of dangers, unanswered questions, and cryptic dreams.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After one particularly anomalous dream in which she learns of the Nine While Nine Legacy, things become truly precarious.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now, someone sees her as a risk&amp;hellip;a threat&amp;hellip;and wants to eliminate her.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Fortunately, she falls under the protection of Gideon&amp;mdash;unless she leaves his territory&amp;mdash;which is the one thing she wants the most&amp;hellip;and wants the least.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;For fans of THIS SAVAGE SONG.&lt;/b&gt;" />
