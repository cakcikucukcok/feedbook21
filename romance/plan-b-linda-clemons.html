  <title>Plan B - Linda Clemons</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Lauren Scott thought she was done with small-town living, but after a short, disastrous marriage and one too many incidents involving stalking and injury, she returned to Whidbey Island, Washington, where she was raised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She just wanted to be happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lauren wished only to get on with her life and career. She looked forward to spending time with the friends she&#39;d had since childhood. But she never expected to be the target of someone&#39;s hatenor did she expect to meet a man who kicked her heart into overdriveand gave her the courage to confront her enemy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Travis Hawke was a scarred military and police-force veteran. After years on the front lines, he had enough of violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He just wanted to be left alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the island, he&#39;d found sanctuary among the trees and beaches, and he knew it would be a safe place to wrap himself in peace and healing. The first time he met Lauren, he also knew she could change those plans. When he learned of her stalker, his retirement plans were put on hold. To save the woman who was healing his heart, he had one final mission ahead of him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to find the peace he and Lauren both need, he has to findand stopthe person who hates her enough to kill.&lt;/p&gt;" />
