      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;From the &lt;i&gt;USA Today &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author who is a &quot;master of witty banter&quot; (&lt;i&gt;Entertainment Weekly&lt;/i&gt;) come a &quot;perfect rom-com&quot; (Refinery29) that proves when opposites attract, sparks fly.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; With her bridezilla friend on a DIY project rampage, bridesmaid Jane Denning will do anything to escape - even if it means babysitting the groom&#39;s troublemaker brother before the wedding. It should be a piece of cake, except the &quot;cake&quot; is a sarcastic former soldier who is 100% wicked hotness and absolutely off-limits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Cameron MacKinnon is ready to let loose after returning from his deployment. But first he&#39;ll have to sweet talk the ultra-responsible Jane into taking a walk on the wild side. Turns out, riling her up is the best time he&#39;s had in years. But what happens when the fun and games start to turn into something real?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &quot;Delightfully sexy and sweet.&quot; -- Lauren Layne, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author&lt;br&gt;  &quot;Fantastic! Compelling characters, tons of heat, loads of heart. I highly recommend!&quot; -- M. O&#39;Keefe, &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author&lt;br&gt;  &quot;When it comes to creating unputdownable contemporary romances, Holiday is in it to win it.&quot; -- &lt;i&gt;Booklist&lt;br&gt;  &quot;Satisfying.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;The New York Times Book Review&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;  What readers are saying about &lt;i&gt;One and Only:&lt;/i&gt;  &quot;A &lt;b&gt;fun, fast-paced, satisfying&lt;/b&gt; read.&quot;&lt;br&gt;  &quot;Cam is my new book boyfriend....This book is going on my keeper shelf.&quot;&lt;br&gt;  &quot;This book was SO ENJOYABLE. Every single page gave me all the feels. I loved the characters, the plot, the writing - everything.&quot;&lt;br&gt;  &quot;A sweet, hilarious and powerful romance story that will warm your heart.&quot;" />
