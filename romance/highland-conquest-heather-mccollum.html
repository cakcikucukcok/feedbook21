  <title>Highland Conquest - Heather McCollum</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Cain Sinclair has a plan. In order to finally bring peace to his clan, he will wed the young female chief of their greatest enemy. Only problem: capturing her and forcing her back to Sinclair castle doesn&#39;t exactly make her want to say &lt;i&gt;yes&lt;/i&gt;. Ella Sutherland may be clever, passionate, and shockingly beautiful, but what she isn&#39;t is &lt;i&gt;willing&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Every attempt Cain makes to woo her seems to backfire on him. A gift? The kitten practically claws his eyes out. A competitive game of chess? Even when he wins, he loses. It seems the only time the two ever see eye to eye is when they&#39;re heating up Cain&#39;s bed. Still, the only thing Ella truly wants is the one thing he cannot offer her: freedom.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when Cain discovers she&#39;s been harboring a secret--one that could threaten both clans&#39; very existence--he&#39;ll have to decide between peace for the Sinclairs or the woman who&#39;s captured his heart.&lt;/p&gt;" />
