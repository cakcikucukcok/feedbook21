      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;New York Times&lt;em&gt; Bestselling Author Karen Ranney&amp;#8217;s captivating series concludes with a tale of opposites whose attraction scorches a trail from the Highlands to the glittering halls of London&amp;#8212;and courts scandal at every turn . . .&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Politics has introduced MP Logan McKnight to many fascinating people, but the lady he encounters on the lands bordering his ancestral Scottish home outshines them all. Eleanor Craig of Hearthmere seats a Thoroughbred like a queen, knows as much about world events as any of his colleagues&amp;#8212;and is engaged to one of the worst men Logan knows. She also seems lonely, so Logan brings her a friend. Thus should their acquaintance end, yet it&amp;#8217;s only just begun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The puppy Logan delivers is every bit as irresistible as the man himself. How could this stranger sense the isolation Eleanor suffers among her scheming, snobbish extended family and fianc&amp;#233; who control her life? It&amp;#8217;s even worse in London&amp;#8212;until she begins meeting Logan secretly in a secluded park. Their passionate connection frees Eleanor, body and soul. But discovery threatens disgrace&amp;#8212;or worse.&lt;/p&gt;" />
