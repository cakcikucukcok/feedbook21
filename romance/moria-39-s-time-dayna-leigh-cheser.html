  <title>Moria&#39;s Time - Dayna Leigh Cheser</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Old Agnes MacKendall has a vision of Janelle Graysons infant daughter, Moria, as a young woman, far from home in a dangerous place. 
Janelle and her husband, Richard, must prepare their little girl for whatevers ahead. Its a future charged with risk that could spell certain doom.
So begins Morias TimeBook 2 of the TIME Series. 
At six-years old, Moria starts to learn about her heritage. Like her mother, Moria is a MacKendall. The women of this Scots clan have many skills, including natural medicinewhich is Morias gift. 
At fourteen, Moria meets Elizabeth Blackwell who befriends and mentors her, guiding her toward her goal of becoming a doctor.  
Later, while visiting family in England, Moria meets Florence Nightingale. The family also meets Queen Victoria and Prince Albert.
Miss Nightingale summons Moria to London, where she works for a while at a charity hospital and meets Dr. Simon Hensley. 
Miss Nightingale takes 38 nurses, including Moria, to the Crimean War. Dr. Hensley, in love with Moria, follows her, much to her chagrin, and she rebuffs him. 
At home for a visit, Moria reconnects with her twin sister, Adelle, and Walter, who convinces Moria that Dr. Hensley isnt the enemy. Moria and Dr. Hensley work things out. 
Simon and Moria return to London after the war. At Devonwood, the Grayson family estate, Morias Grandmother convinces Moria she can marry Simon. He proposes; she accepts. 
After the wedding, Simon and Moria visit medical schools for interviews. Moria is rejected, simply because shes woman. Finally, a school in Pennsylvania accepts her. 
Does Moria continue to impose her needs on Simon? How long will Simon put his life on hold? Do they really want to open a practice? There are too many questions, and too few answers." />
