  <title>Sealed With a Kiss (Mills &amp; Boon Kimani Arabesque) - Gwynne Forster</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;For artist and free spirit Naomi Logan, sexy radio call-in host Rufus Meade is the wrong man at the wrong time. His conservative views drive her crazy–especially his theories about working women. But after telling him what she thinks–on the air–the last thing she expects is to see him standing on her doorstep…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;handsome, outspoken and sexier than any man has a right to be.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It seems that opposites not only attract, they ignite! His kisses leave her breathless. And she&#39;s awakened feelings in him that he&#39;s never felt before. But a failed marriage and the responsibility of raising two young sons alone make Rufus wary of getting too close. Then Naomi uncovers a shocking secret from her own past…a secret that could drive Rufus even further away.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Will their romance lead to heartbreak or happiness for two very different people who are exactly the same…in their desire for love?&lt;/p&gt;
