  <title>Lavina - Author O. Wright</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Lavina: The Saga of an African Princess (The Complete Story) depicts a heartrending, and sometimes distressful, historical narrative of a beautiful young tribal princess named Lavina from West Africa. This poignant narrative tells how she and her promised one Rabboni were unmercifully taken from their homeland and brought to the colony of Virginia. They were then sold as slaves to endure the harsh abuses and cruelties of the fields. 
      Separated and alone, Lavina is purchased by a compassionate elderly couple, while Rabboni suffers at the hands of different slave owners. However, with deep and abiding faith in their Almighty Protector, they miraculously find each other again and fulfill the promise made at their sacred market place. 
      Told in graphic and honest detail, this authors portrayal of their deep faith in their Almighty Protector shows again and again how these two unfortunate people survived the harsh and intricate system of oppression marshaled against them. 
      This historical narrative is an excellent read for all Americans, particularly young African Americans, interested in learning more about the American history involving their ancestors most horrific existence as slaves in Colonial Virginia. Read and examine the painful, yet moving and exultant triumph of Lavina: The Saga of an African Princess (The Complete Story)." />
