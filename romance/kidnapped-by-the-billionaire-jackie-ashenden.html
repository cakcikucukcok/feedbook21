  <title>Kidnapped by the Billionaire - Jackie Ashenden</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In a Nine Circles novel, there is fine line between pleasure and pain, between sin and salvation. In &lt;i&gt;Kidnapped by the Billionaire&lt;/i&gt;, Jackie Ashenden explores what happens when a man and a woman go from enemies to lovers.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;When revenge and desire collide...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seven years ago, billionaire-turned-bodyguard Elijah Hunt lost everything he had--his family, his future--and now he wants revenge. But when he decides to kidnap the daughter of the man who ruined his life, Elijah gets a lot more than he bargained for. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Violet Fitzgerald is nothing like her corrupt wealthy father. In fact, she&#39;s so disarmingly independent--and irresistible--that she&#39;s downright dangerous...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;there is no place to hide.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Violet never thought she&#39;d feel a connection to her captor. But there&#39;s something beneath Elijah&#39;s steel-bodied exterior that makes her want to know him more deeply...and surrender to his every demand. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, once Elijah&#39;s erotic fantasies become a reality--and he and Violet develop a powerful connection--he finds himself in a quandary: Is he still the one in control? Or has Violet imprisoned him--body and soul? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackie Ashenden&#39;s novels have been called &quot;Tantalizing...explosive.&quot;(Publishers Weekly, starred review) and &lt;i&gt;Kidnapped by the Billionaire &lt;/i&gt;is no exception.
