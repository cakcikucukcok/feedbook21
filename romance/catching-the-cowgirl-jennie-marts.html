  <title>Catching the Cowgirl - Jennie Marts</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;California video game designer Adam Clark knows that, in his business, authenticity is the key. So, for their newest Western adventure game, he and his partners decide to try out Cowboy Camp. Only Adam&#39;s friends never arrive, leaving him a bit--okay, a &lt;i&gt;lot&lt;/i&gt;--preoccupied, trying to resist the gorgeous cowgirl who owns the ranch.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Single mom Skye Hawkins is too busy trying to keep her family&#39;s dude ranch out of the red to even think about romance. But she&#39;s having trouble avoiding Adam. He&#39;s smart, he&#39;s sweet, he&#39;s funny...and he&#39;s hot! Maybe it&#39;s the mountain air, but she finds herself letting down her guard. And the fireworks are definitely worth it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The only problem--they live in totally different worlds. Still, Adam is nothing if not resourceful. Sure, he wants to catch the cowgirl. But more importantly, he needs to find a way to keep her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Cotton Creek Romance series is a standalone, full-length story that can be enjoyed out of order.&lt;br&gt;Series Order:&lt;br&gt;Book #1 Romancing the Ranger&lt;br&gt;Book #2 Hooked on Love&lt;br&gt;Book #3 Catching the Cowgirl&lt;/p&gt;" />
