  <title>Drury (Mills &amp; Boon Intrigue) (The Lawmen of Silver Creek Ranch, Book 11) - Delores Fossen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;h2&gt;An FBI agent must protect his ex and her newborn baby in the latest saga by USA TODAY bestselling author Delores Fossen &lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Meet the Lawmen of Silver Creek Ranch&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;FBI agent Drury Ryland is no stranger to surprises. But upon returning to his family&#39;s cattle ranch in Texas, he&#39;s confronted with the ghosts of his past…and a threat to his future. Caitlyn Denson is the beautiful woman who broke his heart and the last person Drury expected to reunite with. But his ex didn&#39;t arrive at Silver Creek Ranch alone.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With a killer on her trail and a newborn daughter in her arms, Caitlyn must put aside her tumultuous history with Drury and focus on survival. Drury feels obligated to protect the family he never had, but professional boundaries begin to blur as their enemy shifts into stark focus.&lt;/p&gt;
