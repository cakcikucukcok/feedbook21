        &lt;h2&gt;THE INTERNATIONAL BESTSELLING AUTHOR&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;‘The &lt;strong&gt;most successful novelist&lt;/strong&gt; on Planet Earth’ – Washington Post&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;THE RETURN OF RAFE MACKADE&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The Mackade Brothers - The Embodiment of Tall, Dark, And Dangerous&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The irresistible brothers are once again stirring the hearts of every female that crosses their path. The bad boy of the bunch has returned home after ten years, appealing as ever. Not even lovely Regan Jones, the town&#39;s reserved antiques dealer, is immune to Rafe MacKade.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;THE PRIDE OF JARED MACKADE&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For Jared, Would It Be Cold Pride—Or A Warm Bride?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Jared MacKade was used to getting his way—especially when it came to women—but he was getting exactly nowhere with Savannah Morningstar.&lt;br /&gt;The lady was drop-dead gorgeous, and she had a drop-dead attitude that was wreaking havoc with his pride. And when a MacKade’s pride got stepped on, there was bound to be hell to pay…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;THE HEART OF DEVIN MACKADE&lt;br /&gt;He Was The Only Mackade Who Moved Slowly&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Sheriff Devin MacKade had always had his eye on Cassie Connor Dolin. Twelve years of trying to watch over her and her children. Twelve years of being the dependable friend, of seeing his beauty married to a beast. Twelve years of hell.&lt;br /&gt;Now that was going to change, though he knew he’d have to be careful, move slow. But if Cassie came any closer, he might just toss her over his shoulder and carry her off! And he wasn’t sure either of them was quite ready for that yet. But soon…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;THE FALL OF SHANE MACKADE&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Shane MacKade Loved Women.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But he hadn’t met one yet who had him whistling the wedding march. Until Dr. Rebecca Knight. Problem was, the pretty lady was too busy hunting legends on the MacKade land to succumb to the MacKade charm. Maybe it was time to pop the old question. ’Cause this was one woman Shane couldn’t live without.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;To Dr. Rebecca Knight, everything was explainable. Until she started having some very irrational thoughts about sexy Shane MacKade. She didn’t know much about men, but she knew one thing for sure: Loving Shane was dangerous—and Rebecca didn’t like to take chances…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Nora Roberts is a publishing phenomenon; this New York Times bestselling author of over 200 novels has more than 450 million of her books in print worldwide.&lt;/strong&gt;
