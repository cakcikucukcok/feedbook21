  <title>Starstruck Romance and Other Hollywood Tails: A Second Acts Novel - Julia Dumont</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;As her Second Acts Dating Service truly takes off, Cynthia Amas discovers that in the heady world of high-end Hollywood romance, with success comes complexity. In this wildly seductive romp through the lush canyons and lavish neighborhoods of Los Angeles, the line between business and pleasure quickly blurs in a dizzying rush of sex and celebrity. Just as our heroine&amp;#8217;s uncanny genius for matching up her growing roster of exclusive love seekers continues to deepen, her own love life reaches a fever pitch. Things get complicated. And funny. And excruciatingly sensual. Cynthia&amp;#8217;s high-maintenance lovelorn mother, her maddeningly hot ex-fling Max, a long-lost high school crush, and of course her best friend, the libidinous, star-crazed Lolita and her mysterious pack of telepathic canines, are all along for the ride. Not to mention one very rich, very famous film producer. On top of everything else, her newest, most important client is literally the biggest movie star in the world. In more ways than one. When it comes to extra curriculars, he is the hardest-working stud in show business. Try as Cynthia may to hook him up with any number of gorgeous ladies in waiting, his notoriously one-track mind is set on her. She&amp;#8217;s determined to steer the dating service to the next level, but it&amp;#8217;s hard to focus, let alone keep your hands on the wheel, when you&amp;#8217;re hot, bothered, and nearly driven to distraction along the steamy highways and byways of love and lust. What a way to make a living.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
