  <title>Lies, Lust, and Silence - Claire Miles</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The disappearance of a child is a nightmare scenario. For the Farraday family, it is only a start of the true nightmare to come. When their little girl vanishes, they struggle to cope. When unexplained deaths begin to plague the family, questions begin to arise in their community. What might cause so much tragedy in one family? Is it perverse coincidenceor something far more sinister at work? 
When another little girl disappears and her mother is murdered, it becomes clear that these are not random events. Are these deaths somehow connected to a tragedy that occurred a decade earlier, or is another force at play that is intent on destroying the Farraday family?
Left behind in their grief and now fear are five brothers and one sister. Their families are also pulled into the mystery, worried that they might also be at risk of destruction from an unknown killer. Is the patriarch of the family, Alan Farraday, somehow at the root of his familys despair? He had secrets that may have come home to roost and a dark past of lies and sexual scandal that may return to haunt his family again.
The Farradays wait in fear for the next tragedy, and only time will tell whether they will find the courage to take a stand against an unknown foe, or succumb to a family curse too powerful to avoid." />
