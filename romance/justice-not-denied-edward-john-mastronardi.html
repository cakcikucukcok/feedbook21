  <title>Justice Not Denied - Edward John Mastronardi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book tells the story of the impact of a program humanely disposing a massive inherited fortune of criminally generated wealth on both those trying to honourably accomplish this and others determined using every criminal means in their power violently preventing it. 
Carole Masters, a major protagonist in the novel Dancing around the Hill, now in her midthirties, still disarmingly attractive, once cruelly labelled by the press as the Black Widow, was in a disturbing quandary while in the process of launching a major program to charitably dispose her vast, completely unexpected inherited wealth. The huge fortune, unknowingly by her, had been accumulated by her late murdered lover she only knew as David Rosanoff, a successful, very wealthy businessman. In reality, he was Boris Aristine, the notorious head of a major European controlled drug syndicate and responsible for ordering the deaths of her husband, Scott Beaumont, and her Florentine lover, Niccolo Gregorian. Aristines responsibility for their shocking deaths was also not known by her until told of it by a Royal Canadian Mounted Polices chief inspector, Ronald Guthrie.
Julius Silverberg, capo of the New York criminal Syndicate, now the head of its North American operation in Canada and the United States, was warned that a major attempt to close down the Syndicates operations in Canada was being financed by Carole Masterss inherited illegally generated Syndicate wealth. He decided taking action, enlisting the help of Francesco Gianni, the Montreal Syndicate capo, getting rid of the threat. It was a potential death warrant for Carole Masters and those helping her. 
The book relates how this transpired, was ultimately dealt with, and what happened to some of the storys main characters at the end." />
