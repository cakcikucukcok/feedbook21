  <title>The House of Pearl - Robert Max Bovill, Susan B. Flanagan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Pop star Elia Pearl is a respected singer and songwriter with four songs on the Billboard Top Ten. With sold-out concerts everywhere and millions in the bank, Elia should be on top of the world. Unfortunately, all she can think about is her loneliness. But all of that is about to change when Elia is invited to return to a house she has spent the last twenty years of her life running away from.
Elia arrives at the House of Pearl, a Victorian home built on the Sausalito, California, waterfront. She hopes to write some new music or at least take a break from her busy careerand soon encounters a dashing yacht captain named Paul Hamilton. As she comes to terms with a family history haunted by ghosts and betrayals, she and Paul begin a passionate affair, fueled by both the devilish spirits that roam the house and Elias desperate need for love. The tragic tale of the house slowly unfolds, and Elia recounts a story of love and unfaithfulness to Paul that only fuels the spirits plans to threaten her newfound happiness.
In this romantic paranormal thriller, two lovers must survive a ghostly onslaught or else find themselves doomed to become part of the tragic history that lurks in the shadows of The House of Pearl." />
