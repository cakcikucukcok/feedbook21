  <title>The Billionaire&#39;s Demands - Addison Fox</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Billionaire&#39;s Demands (A Boardrooms and Billionaires Series Book) by Addison Fox&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Booth Harrison has made a habit of getting what he wants, be it a new addition to the Harrison media empire, or a better relationship with his half-brother.  But meeting his brother&#39;s new sister-in-law, Camryn McBride, poses a new challenge.  The savvy CFO of McBride Media has a brain he wants to pick...and a body he needs to claim.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Camyrn has spent the past few years helping to rebuild her family&#39;s magazine company, focusing on that rather than her disastrous personal life.  But when Booth Harrison invites her to be the keynote speaker at a sales conference in Hawaii, she&#39;s tempted to combine business with pleasure.&lt;br&gt;But meeting the billionaire&#39;s demands won&#39;t be easy, because someone doesn&#39;t want a merger between them to happen. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Boardroom and Billionaires series is STANDALONE:&lt;br&gt;*Merger to Marriage&lt;br&gt;*Tempting Aquisitions&lt;br&gt;*The Billionaire&#39;s Demands&lt;/p&gt;" />
