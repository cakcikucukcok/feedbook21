  <title>Tall, Strong &amp; Cool Under Fire (Mills &amp; Boon Vintage Cherish) - Marie Ferrarella</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;When Lisa Billings swept into Bryce Walker&#39;s fire station looking for her missing daughter, he was smitten with the enticing single mother. The handsome firefighter had long ago realized that white picket fences and parent-teacher meetings weren&#39;t meant for a man who risked his life on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But Lisa and her little girl made him yearn for the dreams he&#39;d put aside….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Bryce was six feet of temptation-in-a-uniform, but Lisa cautioned herself to watch her step. Yet her heart and her soul-and her body-didn&#39;t heed her warnings…not when tall, strong and sexy Bryce made her feel like a woman again!&lt;/p&gt;
