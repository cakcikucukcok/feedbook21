          &lt;strong&gt;Bulletproof Marriage&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As a highly trained spy, Natalie had faced trouble before. But this time the man sent to protect her was none other than her ‘dead’ husband, Sean McGregor. She’d spent two years mourning this man who apparently had never died; would she be able to forgive him…or would the brutal actions of a madman leave her widowed for real?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Kiss or Kill &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Special Agent Renee LeBlanc was close to exposing the leader of a terrorist cell. Then he showed up in the midst of her op. Mark Alexander, a man who could blow her cover with a word. The desire between them was as strong as ever, but who was Mark really – ally or foe? Hero or villain? Lover…or assassin?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Lazlo’s Last Stand &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Corbett Lazlo, super-spy and elusive owner of the Lazlo Group, had to confront the faceless assassin who was killing his agents by becoming the next target. Then sexy Lucia Cordez stepped into the line of fire and guarding her became very risky…to Corbett’s heart. Although she claimed to love him, Lucia could be the death of him!&lt;/p&gt;
