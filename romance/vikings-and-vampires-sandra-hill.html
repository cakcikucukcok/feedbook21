Instead, she was lulled from a failing marriage to an era of hard-bodied warriors and fair maidens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the world ten centuries in the past didn&amp;#8217;t prove to be all mead and mirth. Ruby had to deal with a Norseman who had her husband&amp;#8217;s face, habits, and desire to avoid Ruby. Determined not to lose the same man twice, Ruby planned a bold seduction that would conquer the reluctant Viking&amp;#8212;and make him an eager captive of her love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Last Viking&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He wore nothing but a leather tunic, spoke in an ancient tongue . . . and he was standing in Professor Meredith Foster&amp;#39;s living room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The medieval historian told herself he was part of a practical joke, but with his wide gold belt, callused hands, and the rabbit roasting in her fireplace, the brawny stranger seemed so . . . authentic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suddenly Meredith was mesmerized by his bronzed, muscular form, and her body surrendered to the fantasy that Geirolf Ericsson really was a Viking from a thousand years ago, sent only to pleasure her. But as she tried to teach him to eat spaghetti and use a computer, she realized he knew an awful lot about the tenth century&amp;#8212;and so little about this one. And as he helped her fulfill her grandfather&amp;#39;s dream of re-creating a Viking ship, he awakened her to dreams of her own. Until she wondered if the hand of fate had thrust her into the loving arms of . . . The Last Viking&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kiss of Pride&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some men are too bad to be true . . .&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is he really a Viking with a vampire&amp;#39;s bite? An angel with the body of a thunder god? A lone wolf with love on his mind? Alexandra Kelly, his prey, thinks Vikar Sigurdsson is either flat-out crazy or he&amp;#39;s trying to maneuver her into his bed&amp;#8212;which is hardly where a professional reporter should conduct an interview, tempting as that prospect might be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And some men are too good to be true . . .&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until Vikar does something a teensy bit unexpected, and Alex begins to wonder whether her mystery man could really be everything he says he is: a Viking Vampire Angel on a thousand-year-long mission with his pack of sinful brothers&amp;#8212;and a man who&amp;#39;s finally found the woman of his dreams. By then, Vikar is already wrapping his chiseled arms around Alex&amp;#39;s body . . . and sinking his wicked fangs right into her neck. If this is sin, why does it feel so good?&lt;/p&gt;" />
