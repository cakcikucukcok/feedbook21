      <meta name="description" content="Book 2&amp;nbsp;of the Fifty Recipes For Disaster New Adult Romance Series&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A New Adult Romance Story&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A new chef arrives on the scene and makes Kiara an offer she can&amp;#39;t refuse.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;***Due to sexually graphic content and language that some may find offensive, this book is intended for mature readers only***&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Life in the Fission kitchen has become difficult for Chef Kiara Sands. While she tries to focus on her work, the rest of the employees pass their time gossiping about her boyfriend, Executive Chef Paul Weston, and the baby he&amp;rsquo;s expecting with former employee Jenny Foster. Kiara loves Paul, and she&amp;rsquo;s trying to accept the idea of raising Jenny&amp;rsquo;s child with him. &amp;nbsp;But Paul isn&amp;rsquo;t making things easy. His time is consumed with getting ready for the baby, and he&amp;rsquo;s pushing most of his workload off on Kiara. Instead of an apprentice, Kiara is acting more like manager in the kitchen.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As Kiara and Paul&amp;rsquo;s relationship is tested, a new threat arrives in the form of celebrity chef James O&amp;rsquo;Toole. After enjoying a meal at Fission, the charming, world famous chef busts into the kitchen and offers Kiara a job in his classy New York restaurant. As Kiara considers his offer, another temptation arrives. Chase Abbott is a charming Southern football player with dreams of becoming a chef. Kiara feels pulled in three different directions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Will she follow her dreams and accept James&amp;rsquo;s offer? Can she do that without ruining her relationship with Paul? Or is the young, carefree Chase the man she&amp;rsquo;s supposed to be with?&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
