        &lt;p&gt;COMMANDING. DEMANDING. THRILLING.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;MARRIAGE AT HIS CONVENIENCE&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Five years ago Amber’s multimillionaire Greek boyfriend, Lucas Karadines, informed her that he was getting married – to someone else! So Amber put Lucas behind her – until she inherited half his company. But Lucas is single again, and now he wants to marry Amber!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;ARISTIDES&#39; CONVENIENT WIFE&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Leon Aristides believes in money, power and family. So when his sister dies, leaving a son, he acts quickly and ruthlessly. He finds the woman who has guardianship of his nephew and insists she marry him! But Helen wants more…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;THE BILLIONAIRE&#39;S BLACKMAILED BRIDE&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Anton Diaz is hell-bent on revenge; he seduces and marries the innocent daughter of his enemy. It is no hardship, as Emily Fairfax is as beautiful as she is virginal. They spend their days parted in anger and their nights locked in passion…&lt;/p&gt;
