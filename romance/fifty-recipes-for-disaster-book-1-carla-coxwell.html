  <title>Fifty Recipes For Disaster - Book 1 - Carla Coxwell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Book 1&amp;nbsp;of the Fifty Recipes For Disaster New Adult Romance Series&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A New Adult Romance Story&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Mixing the highly charged hormones of a young woman with a handsome and sexy master chef is a sure fire recipe for disaster. Will Kiara be able to focus on her work and achieve her dream? Or will the drama unfolding around her turn that dream into a nightmare?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;***Due to sexually graphic content and language that some may find offensive, this book is intended for mature readers only***&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Trying to win a competition for best chef is cut-throat business.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Kiara Sands has just won the opportunity of a lifetime. After working her way through high-school and her first two years at Le Cordon Bleu College of Culinary Arts, she is awarded the chance to compete with two other culinary students for a coveted apprenticeship at one of Austin&amp;Otilde;s most popular restaurants.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When she arrives at Fission, she has no idea just how much her life is going to change. She is immediately introduced to Jenny Foster and Robbs Martin, her competitors in the cut-throat competition. The only thing Kiara finds more distracting than Robbs&amp;Otilde; hateful attitude is the handsome executive chef, Paul Weston. It doesn&amp;Otilde;t help matters that Paul is quite taken by Kiara, and showers her with more attention than he gives her competitors.&lt;br /&gt;
