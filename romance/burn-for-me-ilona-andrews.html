  <title>Burn for Me - Ilona Andrews</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;#1 &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Ilona Andrews launches a brand-new Hidden Legacy series, in which one woman must place her trust in a seductive, dangerous man who sets off an even more dangerous desire . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevada Baylor is faced with the most challenging case of her detective career&amp;#8212;a suicide mission to bring in a suspect in a volatile situation. Nevada isn&amp;#39;t sure she has the chops. Her quarry is a Prime, the highest rank of magic user, who can set anyone and anything on fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then she&amp;#39;s kidnapped by Connor &amp;#34;Mad&amp;#34; Rogan&amp;#8212;a darkly tempting billionaire with equally devastating powers. Torn between wanting to run and wanting to surrender to their overwhelming attraction, Nevada must join forces with Rogan to stay alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rogan&amp;#39;s after the same target, so he needs Nevada. But she&amp;#39;s getting under his skin, making him care about someone other than himself for a change. And, as Rogan has learned, love can be as perilous as death, especially in the magic world.&lt;/p&gt;" />
