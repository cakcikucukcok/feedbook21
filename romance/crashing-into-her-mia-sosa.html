  <title>Crashing into Her - Mia Sosa</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;Mia Sosa delivers wish fulfillment with off-the-charts sparks.&amp;#8221; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8212;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Entertainment Weekly&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relationships are a thing of the past for Eva Montgomery. Her current motto? You can&amp;#8217;t spell &amp;#8220;manipulative&amp;#8221; without &lt;em&gt;man&lt;/em&gt;. But Eva has needs, and a one-night-stand at her best friend&amp;#8217;s wedding is the perfect way to kick off her new approach to singledom. Then a job opportunity puts her in the same city with the guy she can&amp;#8217;t forget . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthony Castillo is a perpetual bachelor&amp;#8212;no strings, just flings&amp;#8212;a status he maintains by being honest about his intentions and never looking back. So why is he still thinking about the firecracker of a woman who rocked his world at his cousin&amp;#8217;s wedding? It&amp;#8217;s a question he refuses to answer, until she comes crashing back into his life, taking his emotional walls down with her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When her father doubts her ability to make it in LA, Eva vows to go big and prove him wrong. With her athletic background, she&amp;#8217;s an ideal candidate for stunt work. But first she&amp;#8217;ll need training, and the instructor is none other than her former hookup, Anthony Castillo. Except he&amp;#8217;s not as cocky as she remembers and he&amp;#8217;s definitely still sexy as sin. The only problem is . . . Anthony doesn&amp;#8217;t want her anywhere near his stunt school&amp;#8212;or his heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;Snappy writing imbued with a deliciously acerbic sense of humor . . . the new go-to author for fans of sassy and sexy contemporary romances.&amp;#8221; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8212;&lt;em&gt;Booklist&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;" />
