  <title>Lost Love Found - Tim Gomes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Even though two years have passed since the September 11 terrorist strikes, Dan Jagger is still fraught with grief over the loss of his wife who was killed in the attacks. Dan buries himself in work, family, and gardening while facing the harsh reality that he may never again experience another love like Alia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day Dan receives a phone call from Charlene, his high school sweetheart, whom he hasn&#39;t heard from since she broke his heart and sent him into the arms of Alia. Against his better judgment, Dan agrees to meet his former lover for dinner and soon learns that Charlene has lived a sordid life-twice married to a drug dealer and incarcerated herself. Despite all he has learned, Dan becomes involved with Charlene once again, setting in motion a course of events that leaves him vulnerable to danger. As he is unwillingly drawn into life-threatening scenarios executed by Charlene&#39;s former husband, an ex-convict focused on revenge, Dan receives the shocking news that his only son, an Army Reservist, has gone missing in Iraq.&lt;br /&gt;
As fear, unease, and peril surround Dan, he must act decisively before he loses everything he has ever loved.&lt;br /&gt;
