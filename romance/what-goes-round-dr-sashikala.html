  <title>What Goes Round… - Dr. Sashikala</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Three feminine personae, three identities, three different times and three settings- yet with a similar kind of inimitability evident through different modes- this is a saga of womanhood- perceived by many but courageously pursued by the very few women who dare!
Gina, with her passion to explore, learn and live finds it difficult to transcend her times- the late seventies and early eighties- and ends up battling her quandary that sucks her deep into its vortex and she finally resigns herself to the demands of powers beyond her recon. Ginas explorations run aground when she is brought within the framework of conformity.
Ranjani, on the other hand walks into her difficulties with her vanity that pronounces the trials and trepidations as life and conceals behind the shielding comfort of inaction. She needs to be prodded and jolted out of self-deception when she finally takes a call- before it is too late. With the door open right in front of her all the time, she abstains from taking the much required first step because of her inert disposition. It requires a disaster to get her proactive.
But Shree refuses to drop her defence and distances herself from everyone including herself, to feel liberated. She is ultimately drawn back to life by that one thing that makes the fight worthwhile- the core essence of life! 
Shree achieves that which eluded Gina and Ranjani, though both had the right perspective and the strong desire to live, but lacked the drive to really do so with passion and conviction. Shree attains what could have been Ginas possession and what was Ranjanis deprivation- LOVE! 
These women are three varied manifestations!
The end of one marks the beginning of another!
Life is indeed genderless, cyclic and eternal and transcends all temporal and spatial boundaries!" />
