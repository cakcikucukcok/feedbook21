  <title>Love on a Whirlwind - J. Jean Elliott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;br&gt; One thing Rachel Hardison knew for sure was that she did not want to find herself twice divorced at age twenty nine as was her older sister Devon, who was in the midst of ending her second marriage, so since all every man ever wanted in her experience was just one thing and she had no intention of satisfying their boody calls, at age twenty four, she had contented herself with being single.  And while she would love to find a man who would be able to look past her face and her body and love her for herself the way she would want to love him, Rachel simply did not see that happening.  So when she arrived in Alaska for her older brother Georges wedding to his boss, Stacey, an Alaska native, the last thing Rachel arrived looking for was a man.  Instead, what was on her mind was sightseeing and plenty of it, and with George having lived in Anchorage for five years now, he would know every nook and cranny to take her to. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt; Only problem she discovered once having arrived at the fancy Anchorage hotel owned by his fiance was that George was too busy putting last-minute touches on Saturdays wedding as well as handling last-minute hotel business in preparation for his and Staceys honeymoon to show her around.  And with Alaska being the habitat of bears and other such wildlife and wilderness trappings that could prove dangerous to a visitor untaught in its ways, George offered to get one of his groomsmen to stand in as a tour guide for her. &lt;br&gt; 
&lt;br&gt; It is on that note that he asks her to guess whos standing in as his best man, and when she asks him who and he tells her Felix Latham, Rachel cant believe it!  Felix Latham--his gorgeous best friend from college, who fell head-over-heels in love with their sister Devon, who dated him briefly before dumping him to the wayside and forgetting him completely!  That said, Rachel had not heard his name in ten years, surprised George had kept in touch with him after all that time.  And indeed George had--to hear him tell it, Felix was presently an actor on a New York soap opera, had been for six years, and had the Emmys to prove it.  Rachel simply couldnt believe that Felix was that successful, much less a famous actor!  George then suggests that Felix would make an excellent tour guide for her, and when Rachel naturally asks why when hes not a native any more than is she, George tells her that hes been at the hotel for over a week now, having upset half his female staff getting them to show him around while theyre off-duty.  Rachel doesnt doubt that for a minute, always having thought of Felix as a lady killer, with the exception of being unable to keep Devon wrapped around his finger.  Small wonder hed become an actor, she thought!  And so she agrees to let Felix be her tour guide provided hes up to it--just as she anticipates the reaction shes going to get when he sees how Georges kid sister filled out since the last time he saw her, not to mention she wasnt exactly a dog, either! &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt; And indeed again, when George finally does reintroduce his old friend to the kid sister he hasnt seen in ten years, Felix cant believe it any more than he can keep his eyes off her.  In fact, despite the fact that he is still clearly in love with Devon, the disappointment he feels at learning from Rachel that Devon is in the midst of a divorce and thus wont be there to attend the wedding is almost eclipsed by his excitement at the thought of showing her all the fabulous places in and around Anchorage that he has been avidly exploring the length of his stay thus far, knowing shell provide a most pleasant and familiar distraction. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt; And so he agrees to be her tour guide for the next three days and they have so much fun, not to mention, so much in common, that Rachel is bent on keeping it from happening despite Felixs equal determination that it does.
