  <title>Undeniable Fate - Mia London</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Was it fate that the hotel in Rome double-booked her room and he, of all people, walked through the door?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Project manager Lily Bennett dreads the trip to Italy for she suspects a pink slip awaits her return. Fate brings her fantasy man alive when Brandon enters her room by mistake. Kiss by kiss, he breaks down her insecurities making the next four days the best (and hottest) of her life. But when she dares to hope for more, he becomes distant. Now, to forget this man she knows so little about, who&amp;rsquo;s turned her world upside down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brandon Morgan is driven, successful, and wealthy. Handed his father&amp;rsquo;s company at thirty-six, he is not about to let his family, his employees, or Wall Street down. His company&amp;rsquo;s latest acquisition will prove he can handle anything thrown his way. He just hadn&amp;rsquo;t planned on the encounter of a lifetime with Lily. He craves for her like a heart needs to beat, but a relationship is absolutely out of the question.&lt;/p&gt;" />
