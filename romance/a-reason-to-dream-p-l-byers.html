  <title>A Reason to Dream - P. L. Byers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Brenna Harris was a nurturer at heart. Having lost her sister at a young age, then having to watch her parents marriage fall apart, she quickly learned that it was up to her to take on the responsibility to care for and protect the people around her.
Grant Warner preferred a solitary existence. As a police detective, he often found himself sitting in his car watching a suspect or going under cover with only himself as company. After the falling out he had with his family, the solitude suited him. He didnt need, nor did he want the responsibility of having to make anyone else happy.
Then one fateful day, while working undercover to solve a murder case, Grant watched helplessly as a beautiful stranger stepped forward to protect him, putting her own life at risk. From that moment on, their lives became inherently entwined.
As Grant works with his department to help solve a series of murders, he fights equally hard against his attraction to Brenna. When she comes under threat from some unknown assailant, he has no choice but to step in to protect her. As much as he wants her safe, being with her goes against the self-imposed, singular existence that he prefers.
Can Brenna show Grant that a life with her is worth the risk? Will Grant allow her in or will he walk away from her like he did his own family?" />
