  <title>Cupid&#39;s Playground - Nichole A. Carter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I feel my heart racing when I see his face.  I lose all my words when he smiles at me.  My best moments are alone in my bed when I dream of him.  He&#39;s my best friend.  I feel intoxicated by his touch.  Suffocation when he&#39;s near.  Motivated when I see his girlfriend, to let him know I&#39;m the one.  His name is Jason.  It&#39;s confession time.  I&#39;m in love with my best friend.
My name is Melissa, and I&#39;ve been best friends with Jason since grade school.  It&#39;s now senior year, and I&#39;m determined to let him know how I feel about him.  With the help of Cupid and my friend, Kerri, I hope to find the words to tell him how I feel.
The feelings that I have for this man is unexplainable.  I desire him in a way that makes me re-think my good girl status.  He makes it so easy loving him with his charming, sweet, and gentlemen ways.  I can&#39;t take being in the friends zone with him  anymore.  Girlfriend or not, I need his undivided attention.
It&#39;s wrong to have this much lust for one individual person.  I never been kissed.  Never been touched, and yet have this undeniable desire for him to be the first everything.  I&#39;m stingy and selfish wanting him to leave her altogether.  It&#39;s senior year, and I&#39;m not stopping, until he&#39;s mine." />
