  <title>A Mother&#39;s Claim (Mills &amp; Boon Superromance) - Janice Kay Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Who has the best claim on the child?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It’s been more than ten years since exhausted new mother Dana Stewart took a nap while her baby was sleeping and woke up to find him gone. The loss devastated her—and her marriage—and she’s never given up hope of finding Gabriel. She never expected that when she finally did, he’d be almost a teen, his name would be Christian…and he and his uncle Nolan Gregor would want nothing to do with her.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Nolan, a former army ranger, proves as possessive of her son as Dana is. It&#39;s like King Solomon&#39;s worst nightmare: she can&#39;t rip her child away from the only parent he&#39;s ever known. But she’s his mum and she’ll never lose him again.&lt;/p&gt;
