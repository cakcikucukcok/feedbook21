  <title>When a Heart Finds Wow! - Brenda Hill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Janice and Marvin Perry have been married for eight months, although theyve dated off and on for ten years. Janice was surprised when Marvin proposed. He always seemed to be a player who enjoyed the freedom of lying and cheating. Still, she thought she loved him, so Janice agreed. Eight months in, though, matrimonial bliss has faded. Janice is sure Marvin is cheating on her already. She wants to break it off, but they arent just dating anymore; they are legally bound.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Paul and Desiree Davis have been married for seventeen long, tumultuous years. Their daughter, Cynthia, is about to get married. Paul couldnt be happier for his little girl. She has found a good matchunlike Paul and Desiree, whose love has turned cold and angry. Paul knows Desiree is sleeping around, and the night of his daughters wedding, his suspicion becomes reality when a tragic shooting sends someone to the hospital.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Fated to meet, Janice and Paul find each other at a hotel bar. Their attraction is immediate, and in spite of each of their difficult marriages, they are soon inseparable. Love is never easy, however, and outside influences fight to keep them apart. Forces of anger and envy struggle against them, but now that they have found one another, Janice and Paul will not easily relinquish true love. Despite all odds, they might finally be able to make love last for good.&lt;/P&gt;" />
