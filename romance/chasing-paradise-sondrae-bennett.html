  <title>Chasing Paradise - Sondrae Bennett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Alpine Woods Shifters, #2 &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; He&#39;ll do whatever it takes to earn back her trust. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; A vacation is exactly what Ethan needs to escape the mate hungry females in his pack. Determined to have fun, he can&#39;t think of a better way to start than sampling all the different flavors the shifter only resort has to offer, and not the food variety. But after he meets Gwen, no one else holds any interest for him. Ethan came on vacation to avoid mating. There&#39;s no way he&#39;s going to give up his freedom without a fight. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Gwen is devastated when she hears her mate denying everything they are to each other. She can&#39;t sit by, watching him fool around with other girls at the resort. Or worse, crawl back, unable to resist the mating pull but not really wanting her. She needs to get away and her own vacation sounds like the perfect plan. But she should have remembered what her mother always taught her, never run from a predator unless you want them to chase you. The hunt is on.  .  . &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Content Warning: This title contains explicit sex&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;26,000 Words" />
