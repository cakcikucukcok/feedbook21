  <title>Sleepless in Scotland - May McGoldrick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author May McGoldrick, &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sleepless in Scotland &lt;/i&gt;is a charming &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;tale of loss, justice, and passion.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Captain Ian Bell is a tortured man fighting through grief and guilt over the loss of his sister. When she went missing, he searched for months until he found her remains. Now, three years later as the Deputy Lieutenant of Fife, Ian still hunts for her murderer in the dangerous criminal underworld of Edinburgh. He is the &#39;Night Watch&#39; bent on revenge even as he saves others from the same violent fate that claimed his sister. Then one night, a young woman narrowly escapes death and lands at his feet...his late sister&#39;s best friend, Phoebe Pennington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lady Phoebe Pennington--dreamer and storyteller to her family--is a committed reformer writing articles anonymously for an Edinburgh newspaper. One night, in an effort to acquire documents embarrassing to the city&#39;s political leaders, Phoebe descends into the corrupt and seething netherworld known as the Vaults. When she tries to save a street urchin from an assailant, she becomes the target of a violent attack, only to be saved by the one man she has desired for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ian&#39;s attraction to Phoebe is as undeniable as it is unexpected, and she awakens in him passions he thought long dead. Fearful that she doesn&#39;t understand the dangers of this criminal world, he is determined to save her from the risks she takes. Phoebe&#39;s blood burns for Ian, but when she learns that he may be implicated in the scandal she is set on exposing, she finds herself torn between love and truth. But even as they strive to find the meaning of trust, fate is taking a hand. For Phoebe is the only one who has seen the face of the killer, and the sinister shadows of evil are closer than they imagine.&lt;/p&gt;" />
