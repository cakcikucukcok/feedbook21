  <title>For The Love Of A Father - Douglas Mayweather</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
A young man doesn&amp;rsquo;t know what he&amp;rsquo;s been looking for all his life until he finds it in the most unexpected place... the arms of his wife&amp;rsquo;s father.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
One afternoon when Blaze returned from jogging and headed for the bath, Jonathan waited a few minutes and then walked into the bathroom.&amp;nbsp; As anticipated, Blaze was nude.&amp;nbsp; Instead of saying something like, &amp;rdquo;Oops&amp;hellip;sorry,&amp;rdquo; and retreating he said, &amp;ldquo;Oh, sorry&amp;hellip;I didn&amp;rsquo;t know you were in here.&amp;nbsp; Let me know when you&amp;rsquo;re finished.&amp;nbsp; I need to freshen up before dinner,&amp;rdquo; which gave him enough time to get a good look at Blaze&amp;rsquo;s body from top to bottom, concentrating on his long, hanging cock and balls.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Blaze had not seemed startled nor had tried to cover his nakedness.&amp;nbsp; It had all happened in less than ten seconds, but there had been time for him to at least turn away, which he hadn&amp;rsquo;t, and time for Jonathan to implant the image in his brain.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The ten seconds had come and gone, but as Blaze stepped into the shower he felt aroused.&amp;nbsp; Jonathan having seen his body made him wonder what Jonathan&amp;rsquo;s body looked like.&amp;nbsp; He had never seen him even partially undressed, but he wore his clothes well.&amp;nbsp; That night when he was getting ready for bed he had the thought of &amp;ldquo;accidentally&amp;rdquo; exposing himself to his father-in-law.&amp;nbsp; He found the thought erotic." />
