  <title>A Baby On His Doorstep (Mills &amp; Boon Cherish) - Roz Denny Fox</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;A chance to prove himself…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When Rio McNabb&#39;s bronc-riding career is side-lined by an injury, the only upside is his gorgeous live-in nurse, Binney Taylor. There’s just one hitch – Binney used to have a crush on his identical twin brother. Rio&#39;s sure that he can earn her affection, but then a stranger shows up with an infant boy claiming that Rio is the father!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As a foster kid, Binney&#39;s always longed for a real family. Now, with Rio and the surprise baby, Lonesome Road Ranch feels like the home she never had. But she&#39;s trying to keep things professional, because when Rio heals, everything could change. Rio has competed with his twin his entire life. For Binney and the baby, he&#39;ll finally have to prove he&#39;s the better man.&lt;/p&gt;
