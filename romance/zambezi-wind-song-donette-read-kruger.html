  <title>Zambezi Wind Song - Donette Read Kruger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The cornerstones of the DKG Brotherhood are Gavin Gatling, Kufa Siamkwari and Dominic LEstrange.
At the height of the bush war, (Chimurenga II), without a word to his wife Leocardia, Kufa absconds over the border one night to join the Comrades only to return years later to die in the arms of his beloved.
After years of procrastinating, Gavin finally agrees to adopt a child called Topaz Nyasha, but he does so on the proviso that no one ever discovers the identity of the infants biological mother. Because of this Shirley is convinced that her husband is the father, and for years she hides the details of his own birth from him, but will Monica, the maid, reveal the facts surrounding Gavins roots before the wind song blows the truth through the small fishing village on Lake Kariba?
After Topaz turns 18, Dominic is astonished to learn that she is in fact the great granddaughter of tracker Elias Siamkwari and ivory hunter Sebastian LEstrange, but why should she inherit the gold Huguenot cross with its definitive pearl that symbolizes the Holy Spirit?
In this suspense-filled saga set in the mystical Zambezi Valley, against Zimbabwes political background, the legacy of the Zambezi Wind Song is ultimately fulfilled." />
