  <title>Billionaires Prefer Blondes - Suzanne Enoch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Samantha Jellicoe is enjoying her new legitimate career and her romance with billionaire Richard Addison. Of course, this doesn&#39;t mean she&#39;s gotten over the urge to steal, but she&#39;s been able to fight it off&amp;ndash;&amp;ndash;most of the time. Then she spies someone she never thought she&#39;d see again &amp;ndash;&amp;ndash;her father, Martin Jellicoe. Sam thought Martin had died in prison years before, but now that he&#39;s back, she knows he&#39;s up to no good. Her worst fears come true when a new painting that Rick purchased goes missing. Sam knows her father is behind it, but with the police focused on her checkered past, this won&#39;t be easy to prove. Between keeping her father&#39;s return a secret, searching for the missing art, and saving their reputations, Rick and Samantha&#39;s relationship will be tested like never before.&lt;/p&gt;" />
