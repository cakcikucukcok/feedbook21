  <title>The Billionaire Single Dad - Mandy Baxter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;I am not getting involved with another man again. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;I don&#39;t care if he&#39;s super hot.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;I don&#39;t care if he&#39;s a caring single dad with two adorable kids.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;I don&#39;t care that he&#39;s a freaking billionaire.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Or that he lives across the street.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;And keeps looking at me like he wants to eat me up.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So my ex was a no-good, low-life cheater.  And even though somewhere deep down I knew he wasn&#39;t my prince charming, the betrayal still stings.  I needed to get out of the city and clear my head.  Go drink some wine in a rural cabin in Texas and swear off men for good. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, I ran into a football-playing billionaire who gives me looks so hot it makes me sweat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carter Christensen is a dream come to life.  With a rock-hard body and more riches than Midas, he&#39;s everything a girl could want.  Throw in the fact that he&#39;s got two little twin daughters he&#39;d move heaven and earth for, and the guy is a walking, talking fantasy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the whole point of this escapade was to mend my broken heart and get my libido in check...not get riled up again by the sexiest man I&#39;ve ever seen in my life.  And with the way he loves and protects his daughters, I can&#39;t just flit into his life and then run before things go south.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But still, a little fun on vacation never hurt anyone, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;**&lt;i&gt;The Billionaire Single Dad &lt;/i&gt;is a full-length standalone billionaire romance, with no cliffhangers or  cheating and a swoon-worthy HEA.**&lt;/p&gt;" />
