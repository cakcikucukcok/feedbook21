But Jessie is an old hat at acting. She has picked up the habit of disappearing inside herself and creating characters in order to help herself survive.  Backed into a corner by Deuce McCall, she relies on a tougher version of herself to help her through the dark days while she seeks a solution to free herself of Deuce&amp;#39;s clutches. As she tries to gain a foothold in her struggle, one thing becomes clear - she may have to risk everything she has found - friendships, love, a successful career as a singer / songwriter and actor - in order to save the one thing she loves the most.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Love is a promise, love is a souvenir, once given never forgotten, never let it disappear.&amp;quot;  John Lennon" />
