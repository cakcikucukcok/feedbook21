  <title>The Lost Dreams - Fiona Hood-Stewart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;In the wake of devastating tragedy, Charlotte MacLeod has come home to Strathaird Castle on Scotland&#39;s ethereal Isle of Skye. Burdened by guilt and pain, she remains determined to shelter her daughter from truths she herself can&#39;t face. But the arrival of Bradley Harcourt Ward shatters her tenuous peace.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The handsome American with whom Charlotte once shared friendship–and, almost, passion–is now heir to the castle and land. But he is a man torn between his duties at the helm of an empire and his growing desire to return to the land of his forefathers. And his arrival ignites a string of dramatic events that will change their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For the secrets that have haunted Strathaird Castle will suddenly catapult Charlotte into a glorious new destiny in which she is finally free to love. But to claim the happiness she has so long been denied, she must harness the powerful legacy of three generations of MacLeods–a bold and indomitable will to fight for the impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
