  <title>Moon over Manila - Joe Race</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
ENJOY HOT LOVE AND ROMANCE IN THE PHILIPPINES
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Archeology Intern Heather Kelly gains the opportunity of her academic life and is assigned to work with world famous Robert Kraig, a modern Indiana Jones, doing excavations all over the world. His current work deals with Jose Rizal, the independence hero of the Philippines. She is finishing up her doctoral dissertation on the Spanish American War and needs the information about Rizal, which if all goes well, will likely result in her attaining her doctorate and a lucrative teaching position in California. She doesn&#39;t expect Robert to be so unmarried, masculine and fit, and finds him extremely attractive.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Robert is madly in love with a Filipina, Edie Santos, who owns and manages a respected, successful modeling agency and lands contracts in Davao City and Los Angeles. She is off on her assignments for weeks at a time, and Robert is lonely for Edie and starts drinking too much. Robert&#39;s colleagues warn him that Heather is a sex predator and playgirl.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While Edie is away, Heather makes her move on Robert after a professional presentation at the Manila Historical Preservation Office. Edie hears through the grapevine that Robert and Heather had sex, but Robert isn&#39;t convinced because of his cloudy recollection after too much wine.  Then again, it depends on how you describe sex. Will Edie forgive his transgression?
