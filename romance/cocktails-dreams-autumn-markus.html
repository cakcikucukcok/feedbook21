  <title>Cocktails &amp; Dreams - Autumn Markus</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Jena Baker&#39;s life was a Type-A personality&#39;s dream: job she loved, degree almost finished, great friends... all firmly in her control until one night of insanity when her past collides with her present.   After a New Year&#39;s Eve party in San Francisco, Jena wakes up in a strange hotel room beside her college crush, Nicholas Cooper. Funny thing, but showing her wild side to a man she knows makes the prospect of facing him the next morning infinitely worse, so she slips away before he wakes. Back home in Davis, she decides to let old flames die...but that doesn&#39;t stop dreams of her night with him from coming back to haunt her.   Nicholas wasn&#39;t looking for change, other than a change of scenery. His life was perfectly pleasant, even, and rational...until Jägermeister led to a madly out-of-character night. Now he&#39;s dreaming of an angel his mind can&#39;t quite remember but his body won&#39;t let him forget.   When fate throws Jena and Nick together again, they find their physical attraction is undeniable. But they need to discover if there&#39;s more to them than great sex.   Can a relationship that started somewhere in the middle ever work? Or is it all just Cocktails &amp; Dreams?" />
