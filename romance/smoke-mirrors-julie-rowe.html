  <title>Smoke &amp; Mirrors - Julie Rowe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Someone scratched a death threat in the paint of CDC nurse Kini Kerek&#39;s rental car.  She&#39;s in Utah researching Hantavirus, but damaging rumors about the CDC have left residents suspicious and uncooperative. Thank goodness for hot, sexy, former soldier Smoke, a man of few words, who&#39;s assigned to protect and help her navigate the isolated desert town as she races to identify a deadly virus before more people die.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Memories from the combat zone leave ex-Special Forces soldier Lyle Smoke in a constant state of battle readiness, and he finds no solace, even after returning home to Small Blind. When he meets Kini Kerek, he discovers his heart isn&#39;t entirely dead. But, that might not last long, because this outbreak is no mistake, and he&#39;ll need to use all his survival skills gleaned from the military and his Native American upbringing to keep him and the beautiful, but secretive, Kini alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each book in the Outbreak Task Force series is STANDALONE:&lt;br&gt;* Viable Threat&lt;br&gt;* Smoke &amp; Mirrors&lt;br&gt;* Sleight of Hand&lt;br&gt;* Search &amp; Destroy&lt;/p&gt;" />
