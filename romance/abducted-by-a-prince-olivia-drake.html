  <title>Abducted by a Prince - Olivia Drake</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;She&#39;s not waiting for her prince. He&#39;s not looking for a bride. But sometimes the most unlikely love stories end in &#39;happily ever after&#39;...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SHE WAS STOLEN AWAY&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ellie Stratham gave up her childhood dreams of a fairy tale romance long ago. To repay her late father&#39;s debts, she&#39;s forced to serve her spoiled cousin, Lady Beatrice. But Ellie has devised a secret plan to escape her life as a drudge. A plan that is thrown into jeopardy when she&#39;s abducted by a mysterious stranger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;BUT CAN HE STEAL HER HEART?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A notorious seducer of women--and a scoundrel to boot--Damien Burke has earned his nickname as the Demon Prince. But his plot to kidnap Lady Beatrice to make her brother return a priceless heirloom backfires--and he ends up with their penniless cousin Ellie as his hostage. By the time Damien realizes his mistake, he and his fiery-willed captive are trapped in a remote castle during a wild winter storm. And he soon finds that the true hostage may be his own heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Cinderella Sisterhood series is:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Filled with romance [and] breathtaking passion.&quot;--&lt;i&gt;Night Owl Reviews&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Magical.&quot;--Once Upon a Romance&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Sensual...engaging...beautiful.&quot;--&lt;i&gt;RT Book Reviews &lt;/i&gt;(4 stars)&lt;/p&gt;" />
