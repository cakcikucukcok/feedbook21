  <title>Weekend Agreement - Barbara Wallace</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Weekend Agreement by Barbara Wallace&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cynical billionaire Daniel Moretti works hard, plays harder, and has one ironclad rule. Never trust a woman. Bad news for historian Charlotte Doherty who shows up at exactly the wrong time. Like every other woman in Daniel&#39;s life, Charlotte wants something from him-the deed to her family farm. Daniel agrees, but only if he gets something in return: Charlotte&#39;s company for the weekend! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The property is Charlotte&#39;s only link to the mother she never knew. Desperate to keep her history alive, she&#39;ll accept Daniel&#39;s indecent proposal, but not without a few terms of her own. Namely, a propriety clause. No flirting. No kissing. No sex. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Daniel has no intention of honoring her conditions, but after one weekend with Charlotte leaves him hungering for more, he can&#39;t help wondering if she could be the exception to his unbreakable rule...&lt;/p&gt;" />

(How adorable is that cover?) I have read a few books by this author, and this is by far the best.
