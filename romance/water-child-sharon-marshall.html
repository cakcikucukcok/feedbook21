      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Becky and Elliot are idealistic and artistic twenty-somethings
who met at an elite college and married
shortly after graduation. She&#39;s black and Christian;
he&#39;s white and Jewish. But despite their backgrounds,
families, and the social and political climate of the 1980&#39;s,
they&#39;re convinced that their love, education, and the child
they are expecting are all they need to be happy. When
tragedy strikes, they must confront their vulnerability and
come to acknowledge ways of knowing and lessons about
life they still need to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;ve ever been in love, given birth, experienced the
death of a loved one, or wondered what happens when life
ends, this is a novel that will make you laugh, cry, and
celebrate being alive.&lt;/p&gt;" />
