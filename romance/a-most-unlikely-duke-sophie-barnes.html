  <title>A Most Unlikely Duke - Sophie Barnes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;He never thought he&#39;d become a duke, or that the secrets of his past would cost him his greatest love...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raphe Matthews hasn&amp;#8217;t stepped foot in polite circles since a tragedy left his once-noble family impoverished and in debt. The bare-knuckle boxer has spent the last fifteen years eking out an existence for himself and his two sisters. But when a stunning reversal of fortune lands Raphe the title of Duke of Huntley, he&amp;#8217;s determined to make a go of becoming a proper lord, but he&amp;#8217;ll need a little help, and his captivating neighbor might be just the woman for the job&amp;#8230; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After her sister&amp;#8217;s scandalous match, Lady Gabriella knows the ton&amp;#8217;s eyes are on her. Agreeing to tutor the brutish new duke can only lead to ruin. Although she tries to control her irresistible attraction to Raphe, every day she spends with him only deepens her realization that this may be the one man she cannot do without. And as scandal threatens to envelop them both, she must decide if she can risk everything for love with a most unlikely duke.&lt;/p&gt;" />
