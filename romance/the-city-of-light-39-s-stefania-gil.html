  <title>The City Of Light&#39;s - Stefania Gil</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Aimée was convinced that she would be cursed in love until she opened the padlock she had placed with Laurent on the Bridge of the Arts. Which would never happen, because the key of the padlock lay placidly in the depths of the Seine. When she had time, Aimee went to the bridge and sat in front of the lock to see if by the grace of some divine power, the padlock would open.&lt;br/&gt;
And that&#39;s how she met Gabriel, who was in town enjoying his annual vacation. He was disappointed that the girl he had liked on a dating website had stood him up. He’d been captivated with the photograph of the girl and had thought she could be the love of his life.&lt;br/&gt;
But life takes many turns and when we least expect it, we get a surprise.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;What will the girl on the dating page and Aimee have in common? Will Gabriel be able to help Aimée break the curse of the lock?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;" />
