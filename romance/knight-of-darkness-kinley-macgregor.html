  <title>Knight of Darkness - Kinley MacGregor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For countless centuries, I&#39;ve been the assassin for the infamous Merlin, even though the woman who birthed me sits at the right hand of our enemy, Morgen le Fey. Now both my mother and Morgen have decided that it&#39;s time I take my place on their side of this conflict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normally, telling them no wouldn&#39;t be a problem, except for the fact that the good guys I protect think that I&#39;m an even worse demon than the ones we fight. Hmm, maybe they&#39;re right. I have to say that I do enjoy maiming anyone who gets in my way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least until my mother gives me a simple choice: join Morgen&#39;s Circle of the Damned or see an innocent woman die. I&#39;m all for saving the innocent, but Merewyn isn&#39;t as innocent as she seems. And she&#39;s none too fond of the fact that her fate is in my dubious hands. Personally I&#39;m all for taking the easy way out, but leaving her to Morgen is rough, even for me. Now the only way to save both our lives is to face the evilest forces ever known&amp;#8212;my mother and Morgen. And two people who know nothing of trust must learn to rely on each other or die: provided we don&#39;t kill each other first.&lt;/p&gt;" />
