      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Erin Watters is her small town&#39;s resident wild child--she doesn&#39;t do boring, and after having her heart annihilated, she definitely doesn&#39;t do relationships. Her friends have other ideas, though, and when they throw down a matchmaking challenge, impulsive Erin can&#39;t ignore it. Even when the annoyingly hot Troy Streiber accepts the matchmaker role...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a rescue paramedic, Troy&#39;s used to watching out for people. Never mind the bet he made with his buddy to play Erin&#39;s wingman. But the more time he spends with the sexy, charismatic woman, the more he discovers a side of her she doesn&#39;t let many see. Soon what started as an innocent game of matchmaking has them both thinking about the person right under their nose. But Troy&#39;s a play-it-safe guy, and he won&#39;t let a woman who lives for risk ever steal his heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Secret Wishes series is a standalone, full-length story that can be enjoyed out of order. &lt;br&gt;Series Order:&lt;br&gt;Book #1 Kissing the Maid of Honor&lt;br&gt;Book #2 Her Accidental Boyfriend&lt;br&gt;Book #3 Wild About Her Wingman&lt;/p&gt;" />
