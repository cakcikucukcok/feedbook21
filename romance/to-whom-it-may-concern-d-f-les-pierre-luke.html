To Whom It May Concern: The Night Walker 
A Novel
To Whom It May Concern: The Night Walker is a spin off story about FINN, the main character in the novel; F.I.N.N., which speaks about his traumatic early childhood sexual abuse (molestation) and consequent promiscuous experiences that resulted in psychological scars.  The devastation of losing his parents in the opening of the story, triggered psychotic behaviours in him, causing his past trauma to be manifested in mental instability almost instantly.  FINN sells his parents home and moves into an old house with an annex that is owned by his parents at a different neighbourhood somewhere east of the island of Trinidad.  He opens a small haberdashery-type shop in the annex, which targets the new community of upscale residents and the old residents of the surrounding areas.  His personality captivates everyone in a way that is remarkably caring.  He befriends all of his patrons while interacting with them during the day but experiences memory loss when he falls asleep at night.  He recognizes the need for psychological therapy and visits his doctor but holds fast to the fact that he has to get revenge for the death of his parents. 
To Whom It May Concern: The Night Walker has bouts of revenge, suspicion, mystery, and psycho-sexual intrigue.  A tall black man who walks the streets of a newly developed neighbourhood (Conservation Heights) during the late hours of the evening and night leaves poster-like flyers or notes with the heading To Whom It May Concern and directions of where he could be found in an abandoned park that is part of the new neighbourhood.  He is observed by three married women (housewives) that are married to three young urban professionals (university buddies) struggling to keep their business successful and highly recognized by the government and a same-gender loving (SGL) man (massage therapist) who is struggling with keeping a steady relationship.  The three women and SGL man are friends within this newly developed neighbourhood, each of them live in very modern design homes.  They became suspicious of the tall black man, particularly his physical structure and attire, which got them curious to know more about who he was, where he lives, where he goes and why he walks through the neighbourhood.  They eventually were lured into a trap that caused their lives to change forever.   
	The entire story is fictitious and is based in and around this newly developed neighbourhood and the suspicions that surround the tall black man and FINN who have similar attributes but completely different personalities.  The story has been presented to mimic three steps towards achieving justice, according to FINNs psychotic thinking.  These three steps combine is the structure of the novel in parts:  Part 1 - Bills, is primarily setting the stage, planning to lure his victims into a trap that is pegged on sexual intrigue and mystery.  Part 2  Acts, deal with the psycho-sexual interactions with his victims and altering the initial plan to ensure the end result is met, and Part 3  Laws, focuses on carrying out the detrimental and devious plan of action that will gain the revenge he needs for the lost of his parents without being caught.  The story ends with the authorities being misleading, leaving them in total confusion and turmoil as to who committed the homicides." />
