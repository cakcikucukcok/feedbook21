  <title>Until Mia - E.S Jean</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Everyone knows Drew Lyons... including Mia Thomas. He&#39;s Hollywood&#39;s heart-breaker. He&#39;s her little sister&#39;s celebrity crush. And now, he&#39;s her new boss.  With her mother&#39;s drinking problem getting worse and a little sister depending on her, eighteen-year-old Mia replaces her mother and takes on the job as Drew Lyons housekeeper.  If she hadn&#39;t spent most of her life trying to get her mother to stay sober or taking care of her little sister, she might have actually been normal enough to be excited over the fact that she was now working for Drew Lyons, one of the hottest pop singers in the world.  Even though Mia isn&#39;t impressed by the fame, she can admit Drew has an affect on her. And by the end of the summer, Mia might just be Drew&#39;s biggest fan." />
