        &lt;p&gt;By rights, they should have hated each other. Filmmaker Jennifer Hunter doesn’t want to make a hockey documentary any more than hockey defenceman Axel Rankin wants to star in one.

        &lt;p&gt;The last thing Axel needs is a camera shoved in his face, probing into life and his rocky past. Especially if the woman calling the shots is a mouthy, assertive, drop-dead sexy redhead —who makes him want to do things that definitely require an adults-only rating! His favourite game just got a whole new set of rules….&lt;/p&gt;
