  <title>Dirty Deal (A Perfectly Matched Novel) - Christine Bell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;He&#39;s so much more than she bargained for...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Professional matchmaker Serena Elliott spends her workdays helping clients find love. It&#39;s the perfect gig. She gets to see the good part of the relationships...before things inevitably turn to crap. She leads her own love life the same way. Get in, and get out before things get too complicated. One date with sexy army doctor, Bryan Metcalf, won&#39;t be enough to make her change her mind, no matter how hot it gets...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bryan has had his share of crazy women and isn&#39;t in the market for another relationship that ends by way of restraining order. When Serena Elliott gets into a bidding war for him at a charity bachelor auction, he&#39;s a little worried. Turns out she&#39;s just as anti-relationship as he is, and could be the solution to all his problems. If he can convince her to be his fake girlfriend, he just might be able to spend the rest of his leave in peace. Now if only he can stop thinking about that night on the beach...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But there are other forces at work that believe these two belong together, and they just might find out that happily ever afters do exist.&lt;/p&gt;" />
