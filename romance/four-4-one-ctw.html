  <title>Four 4 One - Ctw</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Passing Ships
I first got the idea for this story, when watching the TV evening news. The presenter was interviewing a very famous female singer/actress from America, {obviously her name has to remain a secret} she was over here in the UK promoting her latest single. Looking closely at her face, even though she was laughing and joking, when asked various questions about her life, you could visibly see, a hint of sadness in her eyes. That gave me an idea to use the image of this famous lady, she would be the character in my story.
I know that most people would prefer to be wealthy, rather than poor, and everybody understands that, but being rich is not just about having lots of money. In this particular story, due to the very bad weather conditions, the woman gets a chance to live a normal life, if only for a few days, and begins to realise that what she is doing in her life, is not enough, or maybe too much! 
In the real world, would she want to change?
Who knows! But to be happy and content is everything, isnt it!!!
Survival Alone {maybe}
This story perhaps, has been told many times over the last hundred years or so, and is nothing new, but for a person to be shipwrecked on a desert island, to me it needed something a little bit extra, and different. As in all my stories, in my head, I play the man, who in this case has to try and survive in this hostile environment. With nothing more than a feeling, that someone is talking to him. As the story progresses, I introduce a female who ends up sharing the experience of living on the island. I thought of a well-known and very popular English actress, who a few years ago actually lived on a desert island for a couple of days and nights. When interviewed later, talked about utter loneliness, of the days and nights, in some ways calming yet also quite frightening.
 A world apart from our daily lives.
My Scottish Holiday 
This story came about because of a motorcycle trip I was on with a friend. We called in for a meal at a place called Flamborough Head out on the east coast of Yorkshire. We were sat having a meal in a conservatory looking out to sea, with a lighthouse in the distance. Seeing that lighthouse in all its splendour fascinated me. I remember as a small boy wanting to spend a holiday in one, but I never got the chance. When I got home that evening, after thinking about it all afternoon, I decided to use the lighthouse as a base for a story, and to use again the weather, as a way to tell the light-hearted plot. The man in the story {me again} rents an old fog warning station and cottage for a winter holiday. Every day it seems to offer him a new experience, and without giving out any more details, only to say that all ends well.
Stella Roberts
This was my very first attempt, at writing a story, I only started writing because someone said I was too old {109} and wouldnt be able to think of anything new, mind you a few beers had changed hands by then. That was like waving a red flag to a bull. I must admit though, changing the plot half a dozen times before settling with Stella Roberts.
Its all about a young women {Stella} and her two girls Rose and Holly. Her husband had been killed in a tragic accident at work, and unable to find any work in the area where they lived, and with no money to pay her rent, left her with no choice but to try and find work in one of the mill towns, in this case Bradford. The problems they had, having to walk the forty miles, the near death experience, and then the good fortune, brought about by sheer determination and hard work. Anyway I thought it made for a good story, you might have a different opinion!!!!!!!!" />
