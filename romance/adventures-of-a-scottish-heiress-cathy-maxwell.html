  <title>Adventures of a Scottish Heiress - Cathy Maxwell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;She was determined to marry for love, never expecting that her adventures would lead her to a lifetime of passion.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Runaway Heiress&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like many a Regency miss, Lyssa Harrell longs for love, but knows her duty lies in marriage. Still, when her father promises her hand to a dissolute but well-connected lord, she does the unthinkable ... she flees to Scotland. Not to Gretna Green, but to her family -- and to the castle where her mother once had been so happy. In this  romantic land she will discover her heart&#39;s desire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Man Seeking His Fortune&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But she doesn&#39;t count on Ian Campion. The ruggedly handsome man has his orders: fetch the runaway daughter home! Ian has a price on his head and a dire need for the reward Lyssa&#39;s father offers. Tracking Lyssa down is easy enough, convincing her to return is  difficult ... and not seducing her is impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And Their Scandalous Adventures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon, Lyssa is on the adventure of a lifetime. She has to sleep in the great outdoors, and flee from mysterious attempts on her life. She knows she&#39;s ruined in the eyes of society, but she is willing to face true ruin -- and risk everything for the unimaginable passion she finds in Ian&#39;s strong arms. And when they return to civilization, the two must confront the most perilous adventure of all ... admitting their unanticipated love.&lt;/p&gt;" />
