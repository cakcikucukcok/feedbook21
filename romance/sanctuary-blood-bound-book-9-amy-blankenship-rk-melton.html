  <title>Sanctuary (Blood Bound Book 9) - Amy Blankenship,  Rk Melton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Michael is the one everyone expected to keep his cool in the most dangerous situations&amp;hellip; but they soon realize it&amp;rsquo;s the calm ones you have to watch out for. His power and temper spirals out of control when he becomes obsessed with a girl that keeps stroking his passion only to vanish before he can find out anything about her. With every taste he gets of her, his obsession quickly turns into an addiction.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Aurora is bound against her will to Samuel, an ancient and powerful demon who is still stalking her every move. Keeping her freedom means she must stay one step ahead of the possessive demon. When she finds herself drawn to an amethyst eyed lover, she quickly finds her passion for this stranger is leading Samuel directly to her and the man she wants to protect.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Samuel vows to do whatever it takes to keep Aurora bound to his side. In his need to force Aurora&amp;rsquo;s obedience, he unwittingly stokes the fires of a power he has no hope of extinguishing&amp;hellip; the righteous fury of a Sun God.&lt;br /&gt;
