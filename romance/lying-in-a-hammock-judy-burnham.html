  <title>Lying in a Hammock - Judy Burnham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Julie Madera hates to look in the mirror and cannot remember the last time she felt sexy. A difficult divorce, the demands of single motherhood, and a challenging career at a prestigious San Francisco hotel have taken a toll on her once fit body. But when her employer asks her to travel to Kauai on a special assignment, she seizes the opportunity, thinking it will be the ideal place to lose weight, tone her body, and maybe-just maybe-find the man of her dreams.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Free-spirited Kent loves to tend to his Kauai garden-naked-after an exhausting day of surfing. When the writer and part-time driver picks Julie up from the Kauai Airport, she cannot help but notice his bronzed body and air of self-confidence. But just as her island adventure takes off and the physical chemistry with Kent builds to a frenzy, she discovers he is not who he seems. Now she has to decide if the relationship is worth a confirmation, and if not, whether she can afford to lose him forever.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In this contemporary romance tale, a woman takes a journey of transformation and seduction in a tropical paradise where she is about to learn that perfection is not nearly as important as taking control of her own destiny. Follow Judy Burnham as she unfolds a few surprises along the way in this romantic, Hawaiian adventure.&lt;/P&gt;" />
