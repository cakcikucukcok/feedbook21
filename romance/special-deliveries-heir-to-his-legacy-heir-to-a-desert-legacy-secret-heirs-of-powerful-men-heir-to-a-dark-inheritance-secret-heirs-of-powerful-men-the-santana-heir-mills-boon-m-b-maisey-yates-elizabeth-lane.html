  <title>Special Deliveries: Heir To His Legacy: Heir to a Desert Legacy (Secret Heirs of Powerful Men) / Heir to a Dark Inheritance (Secret Heirs of Powerful Men) / The Santana Heir (Mills &amp; Boon M&amp;B) - Maisey Yates, Elizabeth Lane</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Heir to a Desert Legacy&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Thrust reluctantly to the throne, Sheikh Sayid is shocked to discover a child who is his country’s true heir, and he’ll do anything to protect him, even if it means taking on the child’s aunt!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Chloe James might behave like a tigress protecting her cub, but this trained soldier can see her weak spot. Taking Chloe as his bride would appease the people of his kingdom, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; provide the perfect outlet for the blistering chemistry between them….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Heir to a Dark Inheritance&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Alik is powerful, ruthless and incapable of love. But when he discovers he has a daughter, nothing will stop him from claiming the child as his own.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Jada Patel will do whatever it takes to keep little Leena in her life, even if it means a convenient marriage. Though there can never be a future between them, resisting the powerful Alik is impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Jada thought she’d known desire, but catapulted into Alik’s glittering world, she discovers an all-consuming, intoxicating passion that could melt even the coldest of hearts.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;The Santana Heir&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;He has money, power and a blood connection. How on earth did Grace Chandler think she could fight Emilio Santana for custody of her stepsister’s baby? As Emilio’s orphaned nephew, the boy is, after all, the last Santana heir.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Grace isn’t about to let the child travel overseas without her and accepts the billionaire’s offer to act as nanny. Soon they are in a more…comfortable relationship than either had imagined. There is definite passion pulsing between them, but desire without trust is a dangerous mix….&lt;/p&gt;
