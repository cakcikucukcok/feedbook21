  <title>In the Dog House - Traci Hall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ten years ago, Jackson Hardy joined the Marines, leaving behind a woman he still dreams about. When he&#39;s called home to care for his ten-year-old nephew, no one is more shocked than he to run into Emma again. Or to still have those same feelings. But Jackson isn&#39;t looking for love, and neither is Emma, especially not with him. His precocious nephew, though, and a retriever named Bandit, are about to change that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So what if Emma Mercer is an overachiever? She has plans to get her doctorate in psychology and create a no-kill shelter for the EST dogs she trains. Which leaves absolutely no time for romance. She&#39;s fine with a furry family--dogs don&#39;t teach you to love and then rip your heart to shreds. But young Matty&#39;s situation tugs at her heartstrings and there&#39;s no way she can&#39;t help him...and Jackson. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She may have hotter-than-ever chemistry with the soldier, but forgetting the past isn&#39;t easy.&lt;/p&gt;" />
