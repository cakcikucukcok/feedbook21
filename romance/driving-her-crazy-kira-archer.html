      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Cher Debusshere hates being the black sheep of her posh, well-to-do family almost as much as she hates driving which is exactly what she&#39;s forced to do when her flight home for her perfect sister&#39;s wedding is grounded. &lt;i&gt;Fan-freakin&#39;-tastic&lt;/i&gt;. Then a hot guy offers to share both the car rental &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; the driving duties...only to drive her crazy by assuming she&#39;s just some spoiled little rich girl.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mechanic Nathaniel &quot;Oz&quot; Oserkowski is about as blue-collar as they come. There&#39;s never been a time he hasn&#39;t worked his ass off, and he&#39;s determined to prove it to the gorgeous princess in the passenger seat.  As the miles pass, they bait and needle each other...until their lust and longing gets so hot it nearly overheats the engine. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They have nothing in common. Hell, they can barely stand each other. But sometimes it takes a journey to change the destination...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Crazy Love series is a standalone, full-length story that can be enjoyed out of order.&lt;br&gt;Series Order:&lt;br&gt;Book #1 Driving Her Crazy&lt;br&gt;Book #2 Kissing Her Crazy&lt;br&gt;Book #3 Loving Her Crazy&lt;/p&gt;" />
