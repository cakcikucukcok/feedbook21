  <title>Rocked by the Billionaire - Mandy Baxter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The sexy Billionaire&#39;s Club takes Texas in ROCKED BY THE BILLIONAIRE by Mandy Baxter. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bad-boy Luke &quot;Lucifer&quot; Blackwell is living the life. Being the lead singer for the rock group Riot 59 has brought him everything he could ever want--billions of dollars, endless parties, and enough groupies to last a lifetime. But when Luke&#39;s wild life starts to wear him down, he returns home to Texas--and ends up in the arms of the one woman who&#39;s always made his heart beat faster than a pounding drum...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kayleigh Taylor likes being a small-town girl, so she&#39;s always been wary of Luke Blackwell&#39;s fast-paced life--and of Luke himself. Fully expecting never to see the sexy singer who broke her heart years before, Kayleigh is completely shocked to find him back home, avoiding the spotlight and pursuing &lt;i&gt;her &lt;/i&gt;instead. Kayleigh knows this can&#39;t be right--his heart was always devoted to his music. But as they spend more and more time together, Luke is awfully convincing that his heart belongs to someone else...&lt;/p&gt;" />
