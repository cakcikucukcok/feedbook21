          &lt;strong&gt;HOPELESSLY IN LOVE&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Youthful, soul-shattering mistakes? Deborah McCloud had made more than her share. She&#39;d believed in her father, only to discover her trust had been cruelly misplaced. And her heart? She&#39;d misplaced that, too, by falling hopelessly in love with Dylan Smith, a man too sexy and too smart for her comfort. Wanting, needing, Dylan was more than she could bear, so she&#39;d left. Seven years ago. And she&#39;d been running ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But now, threats against her family had brought her home to face the people she&#39;d hurt, the mistakes she&#39;d made…and the one man who could rekindle the passion she&#39;d sworn to leave behind.&lt;/p&gt;
