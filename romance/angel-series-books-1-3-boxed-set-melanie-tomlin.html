  <title>Angel Series Books 1-3 Boxed Set - Melanie Tomlin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Helena thought her life was over when the stranger attacked &amp;hellip; now, in order to survive,&amp;nbsp;she must learn to adapt to a perilous&amp;nbsp;new life, and leave everything she&amp;rsquo;s ever known behind.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Angel Series Boxed Set contains Books 1-3 of the Angel Series plus a Bonus Short Story.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Angel&amp;#39;s Kiss - Book 1&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Not mortal, not vampire ... what is she?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
With a mob contract on her head, Helena has kept a low profile, trying to survive by living off the streets. Numb with cold and near starvation, she awaits death in an abandoned house, and gets more than she bargained for, in the form of a vampire.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When an angel -- Danizriel -- alive and the vampire dead. Intrigued, he shelters her and together they discover that she has become something neither of them expected.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Their growing attraction is soon threatened when news of Helena&amp;#39;s unnatural abilities quickly spreads. She becomes the target of a deadly hunt by vampires and Danizriel is placed in an impossible situation when he is told he must kill her.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
With overwhelming forces closing in, Helena and Danizriel face death from all directions. Who will live and who will die?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Angel&amp;#39;s Curse - Book 2&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
What lengths would you go to for revenge?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Helena is furious beyond belief. She can&amp;#39;t forgive the angels for what they did to her, and Danizriel -- one of their own kind -- who sought only to help her. Now she&amp;#39;s out for revenge.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A coordinated blitz takes place on the solstice and thousands of vampires lay waste to the angelic host, in an attack orchestrated by Helena. In exchange for her help she receives three weapons from the time of the fall -- powerful enough to destroy archangels.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
With three archangels down and one to go, Helena gambles with her soul to pull off the kind of bluff that even Satan might fall for. If she loses, the devil takes it all.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Angel&amp;#39;s Messiah - Book 3&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Would you risk everything, for salvation?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Helena -- part earth-bound angel, part vampire -- is pregnant, and it&amp;#39;s playing havoc with her unique abilities. Her usual diet of vampire blood makes her physically ill, one minute she&amp;#39;s visible the next she&amp;#39;s not, and she&amp;#39;s suffering from blackouts.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After yet another blackout, Helena finds herself back in Satan&amp;#39;s clutches. This time there is no way for her to escape on her own, and a dangerous rescue mission ends with Helena going into labour prematurely.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Helena&amp;#39;s child is born and all too soon must leave her to deliver a message to the mortal world. But the last time someone was sent with a message, it didn&amp;#39;t end well ...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The Sands of Time - Bonus Short Story&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Angels. Corruption. Death.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Father Time has been tending the hourglasses in the Halls of Time for what seems like eternity. When the sand in one of the hourglasses changes colour, and stops flowing, he doesn&amp;#39;t know what to do. This has never happened before. Is it an omen that the end is nigh, or something else entirely?" />
