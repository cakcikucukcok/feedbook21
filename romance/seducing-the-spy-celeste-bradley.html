When she overhears details of a conspiracy that could affect her country&#39;s fate, she turns to the one person who might believe her--Stanton Horne, Lord Wyndham. Posing as Wyndham&#39;s mistress in order to root out the enemy, Alicia is drawn into an uneasy partnership...and a wildly seductive liaison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lord Wyndham&#39;s uncanny ability to detect lies has made him a valuable member of the Royal Four, but in matters of romance it has proven a distinct liability. Alicia is the only woman whose thoughts he cannot read...and the only one whose sensual touch quenches every secret desire. As the mission grows more dangerous and more personal, and each encounter with Alicia more fiery than the last, this daring spy must face his greatest challenge yet--learn to trust the passion in his heart...&lt;/p&gt;" />
