  <title>Lake Como - Anita Hughes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Hallie Elliot has a perfect life. She is an up-and-coming interior designer in one of San Francisco&#39;s most sought after firms, and has just recently become engaged to Peter, a brilliant young journalist. But when she stumbles upon Peter and her boss in what seems to be a compromising position, her trust in her perfect life is shaken. &lt;br&gt;So Hallie escapes to Lake Como, Italy to spend time with her half-sister, Portia Tesoro, an Italian blueblood dealing with the scandal of a public estrangement from her cheating husband. While staying in the Tesoro villa, Hallie falls in love with the splendor and beauty of Lake Como, and finds work designing the lakeside estate of a reclusive American tech mogul. The caretaker of this beautiful estate is a handsome man named Angus, and Hallie finds herself drawn to his charm and kindness, despite hints of a dark secret in his past. &lt;br&gt;But just as Hallie is beginning to find her footing on Italian soil, she uncovers a family secret that upends all the truths she&#39;s believed about herself, and calls into question the new life she&#39;s built in Lake Como. &lt;br&gt;Sisterhood, family, career, and sumptuous descriptions of Italian life fill the pages of this newest offering by Anita Hughes. Lake Como is a heartbreaking and heartwarming story of love, self-discovery, and the quest for truth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Love, sisterhood, and sumptuous descriptions of &lt;i&gt;la dolce vita&lt;/i&gt; fill the pages of Anita Hughes&#39; &lt;i&gt;Lake Como&lt;/i&gt;, a heartwarming story of romance, self-discovery, and the quest for truth.&lt;/p&gt;" />
