  <title>When Dani Smiled - Athina Paris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Stranded on the side of a highway, Dani, a young fashion designer and IT expert, calls to reschedule an important interview, only to discover that her future boss is in the hospital. Nicholas, playboy and heir to Galfrey&amp;rsquo;s, can&amp;#39;t help but be intrigued by the young woman&amp;#39;s voice on the phone and races to her rescue.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Attraction is immediate and mutual, but whereas Nicholas has never waited for anything in his life, Dani quickly dampens his enthusiasm by refusing to be rushed into a casual liaison.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sams is handsome, ambitious, and rich, but also self-centred, with huge self-entitlement issues, manipulative, and believes Dani belongs to him. A master programmer, he is also no fool and realises that he is about to lose what he has never had; Dani, and so begins a dangerous stalking game. It is up to Dani not only to outsmart Sams, but also save Galfrey&amp;rsquo;s and herself, as Sams is the keeper of a secret, which he hopes will coerce her into submitting to his twisted desires.&lt;/p&gt;" />
