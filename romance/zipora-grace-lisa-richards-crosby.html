  <title>Zipora Grace - Lisa Richards Crosby</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Just out of high school, Zipora Grace is finished with guysor is she? Camp Chaos needs a counselor. She is determined to be the best and share Gods love with all of her campers, but there she faces one challenge after another. Is she going to make it until the end of campand what about after camp? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then theres her biggest challenge yet: an unexpected heartthrob named Thad Wagner. This is not what she came to camp for. To make matters worse, Pastor Jenkins seems to be in cahoots with Thad, making it very hard for Zipora Grace to resist. At least she has Melissa, her junior counselor, and her best friend, Danielle, to aid her during dire times of crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thad Wagner has been searching for a woman to share his life with. After a tragic love loss, he is ready to move on. Does love at first sight exist? Thad decides that he cant live without Zipora Grace. Can he change her mind? Will his past loss get in the way of what he wants? Thad has to learn to trust God with all things, even Zipora Grace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thad and Zipora Grace have another hurdle to cross. What do they do about their feelings? What tools do they set in place to remain pure in Gods eyes?&lt;/p&gt;" />
