  <title>Second Chance Cowboy - A.J. Pine</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Once a cowboy, always a cowboy &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Ten years ago, Jack Everett left his family&#39;s ranch without a backward glance. Now, what was supposed to be a quick trip home for his father&#39;s funeral has suddenly become more complicated. The ranch Jack can handle---he might be a lawyer, but he still remembers how to work with his hands. But turning around the failing vineyard he&#39;s also inherited? That requires working with the one woman he never expected to see again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Ava Ellis broke her own heart the night she let Jack go. She was young and scared---and secretly pregnant with Jack&#39;s baby. Now that he&#39;s back and asking for her help, Ava sees her opportunity to right the wrongs of the past. But how will he feel about the son he&#39;s never known? Could this be their second chance---or their final heartbreak?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &quot;A fabulous storyteller who will keep you turning pages and wishing for just one more chapter at the end.&quot; -- &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Carolyn Brown&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &quot;Cross my heart, this sexy, sweet romance gives a cowboy-at-heart lawyer a second chance at first love and readers a fantastic ride.&quot; -- &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Jennifer Ryan&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &quot;A.J.
