  <title>Sharecropper&#39;s Daughter - Billy Henderson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt; Penny Parks is a young girl growing up in the rural south as the daughter of a sharecropper in 1949. Penny comes of age through hard times, hard work and the support of her family. She strives to better herself on the Silver Lear Plantation, working for the Hacketts in their office. She has a talent for cutting horses. Penny falls in love with Smith, the grandson and heir to the farm but is determined to chart her own destiny despite their differences.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt; I too was a sharecroppers daughter. It was a hard time but I wouldnt change it for the world. We were taught at an early age to help out with the family, to work and we knew the love our Dad and Mom shared with us kids.&lt;/P&gt;  Ruby Fae Corely
&lt;P&gt; Very touching story. It is cathartic. I could see a little of my own background growing up on the farm. I think all our lives were so different then than a kid sees now. We were innocent, patriotic, and religious. We played outside a heck of a lot more. We had to be creative.&lt;/P&gt; - Tommie Webb" />
