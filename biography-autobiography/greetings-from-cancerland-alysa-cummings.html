  <title>Greetings from Cancerland - Alysa Cummings</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Shortly after Alysa Cummings was diagnosed with breast cancer, she sat down at her laptop computer and began keeping a journal. Over the two years of her cancer treatment, Alysa continued writing as she moved through the healthcare delivery system:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I fantasized that I could somehow use my computer to craft a story with an upbeat next chapter or fairy tale happily-ever-after ending. Looking back, thats the only explanation I can come up with, why I felt so compelled to create a record of my day-to-day experiences as a cancer patient. The one thing I could control were these words that crowded each other as they quickly appeared on my computer screen; these stories that flowed through my fingertips in such a manic rush; these traumatic adventures that happened to me in a place I began to call CancerLand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CancerLand: its this parallel universe, I swear, separate and apart from the rest of life as I once knew it. How did I end up in this wacky Bizarro World filled with freaky language and even stranger rituals? &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gradually her daily journal entries became vignettes and poems that were published on the OncoLink website. Greetings from CancerLand, a collection of Alysas writing from 2002-2012, charts one breast cancer survivors journey as she discovers the power of writing to move her recovery forward. &lt;/p&gt;" />
