  <title>Confessions of an Ivy League Frat Boy - Andrew Lohse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;An account of sordidness and redemption by the Dartmouth fraternity member whose &lt;i&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/i&gt; profile blew the whistle on the frat&#39;s inhumane hazing practices.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Always trust the brotherhood.&lt;br&gt;Always protect your pledge brothers.&lt;br&gt;What happens in the house stays in the house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before attending Dartmouth, the worst thing Andrew Lohse had ever done was skip school to attend a John McCain rally. Growing up in suburban New Jersey, he was the typical American honor student: straight-As, on the lacrosse team, president of the Model U.N. He dreamed of following in his grandfather&#39;s footsteps and graduating from the Ivy League. When he arrived at Dartmouth, however, he found not the prestigious college of years past, but a wasteland of privilege and moral entropy. And when he rushed Sigma Alpha Epsilon, the fraternity that inspired the rival house in Animal House, Lohse&#39;s once-perfect life, as well as his goals, began to crumble around him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lured by free booze and friendly brothers, Andrew pledged Sigma Alpha Epsilon, and soon his life became a dangerous cycle of binge drinking and public humiliation. From chugging vinegar to swimming in a pool of human waste, Lohse&#39;s pledge class endured cruelty and psychological coercion in the hopes of obtaining a bid. Although Andrew succeeded in joining the fraternity, the pattern of abuse continued--except over time, &lt;i&gt;he&lt;/i&gt; became the abuser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Told by a contemporary Holden Caulfield, this is a shocking exposé of America&#39;s most exclusive institutions and a cautionary tale for modern times.&lt;/p&gt;" />
