      <meta name="description" content="Life is a journey. Its path is covered with some smooth surfaces, some bumps, some steep hills and crevasses. Journeys can be lovely or they can be harsh and bitter. What you hold in your hand describes things of my journey. This is not a book in the real sense of the word. It is a series of stories and essays, some of which, I originally intended to simply print on plain paper, staple together, and give to my sons, as a  legacy, of sorts.  
Within these pages, you will meet me as COMMA MAN. You will meet my family and my friends, including my special friend, Bargebottom. This is a collection of the ups and downs, the ins and the outs of a long life, written by a grateful man. Should you decide to leaf through these pages, you may even find a bit of your story here, too" />
