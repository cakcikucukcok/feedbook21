  <title>The Lying Mirror - Hope de la Cruz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It dominates your thoughts, it determines your actions, it demands your attention, it dictates your emotions. What is it? Food. Imagine a life where every day, the thought of food consumes your mind. When you eat, what you eat, how much you eat, who you eat with, where you will eat, its always on your mind. Imagine a life where the more you seek control, the more out of control things become and the less control you actually have. Imagine a life where snakes, spiders, or heights are not your biggest fear but eating, gaining weight, mirrors, and scales are your biggest fears. To many people struggling with eating disorders, this life is reality. This life where every waking moment your thoughts turn to food, and your constant worry is that you are fat or gaining weight. The following is a memoir of a young girls journey as she struggles to overcome the battle against anorexia. The following is a memoir about how a young girl turns from controlling what she eats to be controlled BY what she eats and her journey to give that control over to God, to find her identity in Him, to find satisfaction in the way He made her. Join this young girl as she tells her story about her struggles, fears, and addiction with food and how friends, family, and most importantly God, helped her turn from that path of destruction to the path of healing, recovery, and restoration. The journey is not easy and the path is not smooth, but please join her as she shares her encounters on her journey and shows how God helped to transform her mind from one that believed the lies portrayed in the lying mirror to one that rests in the Truth.&lt;/p&gt;" />
