  <title>They Call Me Supermensch - Shep Gordon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;An eye-popping peek into entertainment industry from the magnetic force who has worked with an impeccable roster of stars throughout his storied career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the course of his legendary career as a manager, agent, and producer, Shep Gordon has worked with, and befriended, some of the biggest names in the entertainment industry, from Alice Cooper to Bette Davis, Raquel Welch to Groucho Marx, Blondie to Jimi Hendrix, Sylvester Stallone to Salvador Dali, Luther Vandross to Teddy Pendergrass. He is also credited with inventing the &quot;celebrity chef,&quot; and has worked with Nobu Matsuhisa, Emeril Lagasse, Wolfgang Puck, Roger Verg&amp;#233;, and many others, including his holiness the Dalai Lama. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this wonderfully engaging memoir, the charismatic entertainment legend recalls his life, from his humble beginnings as a &quot;shy, no self-esteem, Jewish nebbisher kid with no ambition&quot; in Oceanside, Long Island, to his unexpected rise as one of the most influential and respected personalities in show business, revered for his kindness, charisma&amp;#8212;and fondness for a good time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gordon shares riotous anecdotes and outrageous accounts of his free-wheeling, globe-trotting experiences with some of the biggest celebrities of the past five decades, including his first meeting with Janice Joplin in 1968, when the raspy singer punched him in the face. Told with incomparable humor and heart, &lt;em&gt;They Call Me Supermensch&lt;/em&gt; is a sincere, hilarious behind-the-scenes look at the worlds of music and entertainment from the consummate Hollywood insider.&lt;/p&gt;" />
