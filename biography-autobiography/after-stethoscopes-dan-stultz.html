  <title>After Stethoscopes - Dan Stultz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is pretty much described by the title as it is an autobiography and my lifes journey thus far, with an emphasis on my career after the practice of medicine. My purpose is to present my autobiography and how my boyhood growing up in the fifties and sixties effected my adulthood and core. Additionally, the books purpose is to stimulate thought about leadership and what is and is not leadership. After Stethoscopes shares my thoughts on seemingly unrelated essay topics over the last five to six years and shares my experience with deep brain stimulation, an often-unused early weapon in the battle with Parkinsons. DBS has been a miracle gift for me. The book weaves together and my life story with Parkinsons and my experience with leadership and leadersat least my story thus far." />
