  <title>Overcoming the Rain - Candace Taylor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Candace Taylor thinks that failure is her middle name. Her dream of being a nurse and her reality of being a waitress in a pizza tavern were worlds apart. As a wife and mother of two, she becomes depressed. Then opportunity comes 
	Candace happily started attending her local community college with fierce determination to succeed. She develops a crush on her English Professor, David. Struggling with her daily life and fantasies of David, Candace experiences a mental breakdown. Admitted to a psychiatric hospital where she underwent treatment for bipolar disorder, she there learned many lessons about herself, her husband, and about life. 
	Candace does recover. She gives much credit to Joan, her psychiatric outpatient nurse. Joan becomes an advocate who gives Candace someone to talk to about anything. 
	Candace does not skip a beat when it comes to school. She returns to class the following semester and is accepted into Nursing School. The academic work is difficult but Candace knows she must keep it together if she is to succeed. 
	Candace does meet success and graduates as a Registered Nurse. She even resolves her feelings about David. Unfortunately, success is short lived. She fails as Charge Nurse in a small psychiatric facility and loses her job. When Candace recovers from her shame and guilt another chance for success comes her way. She now feels not only able to handle herself, but also able to handle the good and the bad things that come her way. Candace has grown up." />
