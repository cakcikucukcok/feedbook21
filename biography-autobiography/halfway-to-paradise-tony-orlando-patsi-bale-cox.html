  <title>Halfway to Paradise - Tony Orlando, Patsi Bale Cox</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;He&#39;s known the world over for his heyday with Dawn, but that glittering 1970&#39;s whirl was just one chapter in Tony Orlando&#39;s rich life.  Orlando began his showbiz career as a teen heartthrob with the single &quot;Halfway to Paradise&quot; and had a second successful act as a record company A&amp;R man before he was lured back into the limelight as a performer.  Fans from the l960s to the present day have loved his voice, his stage presence and his hits, like &quot;Knock Three Times&quot; and &quot;Tie a Yellow Ribbon &#39;Round the Old Oak Tree.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, Tony has written an autobiography as warm and heartfelt as his songs.  &lt;i&gt;Halfway to Paradise&lt;/i&gt; is rich with stories from the music world-from doo wop to the disco era, from early recording with Gerry Goffin and Carole King to recent concerts in Branson, Missouri and across the United States.  It&#39;s also full of behind-the-scenes detail of how it felt to be at the top of the entertainment heap-with his #1-rated CBS show, Tony&#39;s life in front of and behind the camera was grand, but sometimes not all it seemed.   Orlando succumbed to one of the familiar antidotes to the pressures of a big life: drug use, with its predictable toll on family and friendships.  And even as his career was soaring, he was unable to save his best friend Freddie Prinze from a fatal downward spiral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a return to roots-and to the close-knit family that has always sustained him-Tony restored the order and creativity that have allowed him to thrive through four decades of exuberant entertaining.  &lt;i&gt;Halfway to Paradise&lt;/i&gt; is a wise, funny and spirited life story, and a must-read memoir for fans.&lt;/p&gt;" />
