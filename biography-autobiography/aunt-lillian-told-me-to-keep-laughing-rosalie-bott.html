  <title>Aunt Lillian Told Me to Keep Laughing - Rosalie Bott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Author Rosalie Bott remembers her Aunt Lillian dispensing important advice: Dont forget you are a Bott, and the Botts always laugh! Rosalie has focused on that comment throughout her years, smiling as she faced an array of medical challenges and diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Aunt Lillian Told Me to Keep Laughing&lt;/i&gt;, Rosalie shares her life story in two parts. The first section provides a host of tips, advice, and practical information for those experiencing medical issues, with a focus on cancer and lymphedema. Based on her own interactions with the medical community, Rosalie strives to help other patients survive their ordeal and navigate their own health issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second part of this memoir shares a real accounting of Rosalies medical, environmental, and personal life and their effects on her from childhood through adulthood. These stories form the backdrop of her decisions and attitude giving her the ability to recover and cope through illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A true testament to the power of laughter and a positive attitude, &lt;i&gt;Aunt Lillian Told Me to Keep Laughing&lt;/i&gt; provides inspiration for others who face similar challenges in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;" />
