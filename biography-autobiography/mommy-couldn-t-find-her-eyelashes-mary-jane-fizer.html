  <title>Mommy Couldn’T Find Her Eyelashes - Mary Jane Fizer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;No one knows how unpredictable first graders can be better than a first-grade teacher. In Mommy Couldnt Find Her Eyelashes, retired elementary educator Mary Jane Fizer shares excerpts from written papers and some of her favorite amusing and poignant conversations with her first-grade students, providing an unforgettable glimpse into the innocent, often uncensored minds and imaginations of children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fizer relies on more than forty years of experience in a classroom environment to offer a diverse compilation of funny sayings and heartfelt moments she experienced with her students. From the student who said he wanted to be both the President of the United States and a forklift operator to the boy who announced that he needed to see the nurse because he thought he had head lights, Fizer recalls the unpredictable moments of every day she spent in front of a classroom serving not only as a teacher, but also as a role model, stand-in mother, and a source of information who had to somehow find a creative answer to every creative question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mommy Couldnt Find Her Eyelashes is a delightful collection of quotes from children that encourages all of us to find the pure happiness in every dayeven when we are all grown up.&lt;/p&gt;" />
