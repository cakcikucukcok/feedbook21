I haven’t read anything quite like it before.” - &lt;/i&gt;Lisa Hill ANZLitLovers. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;“Wonderful book; deeply researched, scholarly, heartfelt and well written.” - &lt;/i&gt;Emeritus Professor Roger Fay, University of Tasmania&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;‘... what an intrinsic and fascinating … ultimately beautiful dedication to family to faith and to life.
