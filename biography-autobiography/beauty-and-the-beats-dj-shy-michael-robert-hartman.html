  <title>Beauty and the Beats - Dj Shy, Michael Robert Hartman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;This memoir narrates the story of a Korean-American woman who overcame challenges to become the first female DJ at Americas #1 radio station.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without a DJ, theres no music; without music, theres no party. The right music can make or break a party; promoters, club owners, and stars alike know this. In this memoir, successful turntablist DJ Shy narrates the story of how she became a sought-after DJ and the first female on-air mixer at the No. 1 radio station in America, 102.7 KIIS FM in Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Beauty and the Beats&lt;/i&gt; tells how this small-town girl from Pennsylvania made it to the big time in California.  Shy describes how she  a poor, nave, Asian girl from a broken home  overcame her lifes challenges and the discrimination in the male-dominated music industry to thrive. From surviving a drive-by shooting and eluding midnight stalkers to being cheated on her paychecks, she shares her story and shows how she remained positive throughout her journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Providing a sneak peek into the music and entertainment industry, &lt;i&gt;Beauty and the Beats&lt;/i&gt; provides motivation and inspiration to encourage teenagers to make sound career choices and follow their dreams to achieve happiness and success.&lt;/p&gt;" />
