  <title>Small Feet Walking in Big Shoes - Clayton Mixon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Growing up in middle Georgia during the 1950s and 1960s, author Clayton Mixon endured his share of struggles. Money wasnt easy to come by, and with the tragic death of his father, Clayton wondered how their small family would survive. Yet survive they did; he went on to a successful career in banking and eventually served as pastor for several Georgia churches.
&lt;i&gt;Small Feet Walking in Big Shoes&lt;/i&gt; details Claytons remarkable rise from poverty to success. From the lean days when, as a nine-year-old, he sold peanuts at McSwains Barbership for extra cash to his brief stint in the Coast Guard during the Vietnam War, Clayton shares memories of trying to find his niche in life. But he also vividly shows how the hand of God guided him through the years. 
After he met his future wife, Kathy, things started falling into place. Before he knew it, Clayton had a new job in the financial services industry and a new wife. Two children soon followed. As Claytons family grew, so did his spiritual life. He began to dream of becoming a pastor and finally, in 1990, he surrendered to the call to ministry, becoming a pastor in 1994.
&lt;i&gt;Small Feet Walking in Big Shoes&lt;/i&gt; is a powerful, true story of how one man overcame adversity by placing his faith in God." />
