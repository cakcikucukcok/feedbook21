  <title>Journey to Ithaka: Memoirs of an American Diplomat - Dave Grimland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dave Grimland journeys from his roots in Texas to his final home in Montana via stops in Greece, Cyprus, Turkey, Bangladesh, and India-like Odysseus traveling home to Ithaka.   As a member of the American diplomatic service, he had the rare opportunity to learn about other cultures and religions in a series of exciting and occasionally dangerous adventures.   Take a deeper look into other cultures, and gain new perspectives on old, vexing problems with a Journey to Ithaka.   &quot;In a series of highly readable vignettes, career diplomat David Grimland shares personal experiences from his many years abroad. These entertaining, sometimes suspenseful accounts clearly reflect Grimland&#39;s intelligence, wit, and sensitivity to the cultural differences he encountered in foreign lands. A delightful book. I loved it!&quot;  -George Bass, distinguished professor emeritus at Texas A&amp;M University; founder and chairman emeritus of the Institute of Nautical Archaeology" />
