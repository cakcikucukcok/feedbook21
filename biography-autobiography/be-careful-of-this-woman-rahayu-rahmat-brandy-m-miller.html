  <title>Be Careful of This Woman - Rahayu Rahmat, Brandy M Miller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Treated like Cinderella by a mother who could not love me, I thought my Prince Charming would rescue me from a life I hated and we were soon wed. That was the beginning of a nightmare that took me 15 years to escape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abused, infected with HIV that my husband contracted through sharing needles, sold into prostitution to pay off his debts, addicted to drugs that they injected in me to keep me working, I thought the nightmare would never end. Abandoned and with 4 children to support, I took to stealing just to keep my family alive. I wound up in prison, struggling to get off the streets, homeless and hopeless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once I did get off the streets and my health was restored, I faced the prejudice of ignorant people who publicly shamed me for my condition. I came close to committing suicide. But love broke through the darkness of my life, restored my hope, and gave me a new purpose in life. I share this story not to condemn those whose actions nearly destroyed my life, but to give hope to those who may feel there is no hope left for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I now run a shelter for those who, like me, find themselves on the streets, HIV infected, and with nowhere else to go. This book is dedicated to them and the proceeds of each sale support Sinar Sofia, the NGO we founded to help give them shelter and support while they work to get their lives back on track.&lt;/p&gt;" />
