  <title>X-Sta-Cee Entertainment Escorts - Sergeant Phillip A. Spight</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I have been in the escort business for several years now.  I began in the military back in 92. I was sent to Germany, Bosnia, Hungary and Im sure I have been to just about all fifty states.  I soon found out that women from other cultures are very beautiful creatures.  I love to meet women of other cultures.  They are so different.  Not just different in race, but how they view sex as compared to American people.  What I mean is that sex is a recreational thing to them more than it is a moral issue.  I found myself always surrounded by beautiful women who enjoyed the sex life.  To my amazement, I found that I could make money for myself and others by using these women.  When I returned to the United States, four years later. I created X-STA-CEE ESCORTS.  A small escort service that I ran from my barracks using a cheap computer.  At every duty station that I had, I did the same thing.  Once you get in, its hard to get out.  This was a very exciting and profitable business venture for me.  I soon found myself making more money in a weeks time than the government paid me in a month.
This book is a compilation of what I have learned about escorts, clients and the law.  This is the reason that I wrote this book.  Somebody had to do it." />
