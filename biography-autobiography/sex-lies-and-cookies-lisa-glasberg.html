  <title>Sex, Lies, and Cookies - Lisa Glasberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;One woman&amp;#39;s misguided quest for love, sex, and as much airtime as possible . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On &lt;em&gt;The Howard Stern Show&lt;/em&gt;, radio personality Lisa Glasberg, aka Lisa G., is painted as a violin-playing, cookie-baking cat lady, but that&amp;#39;s all about to change. This alleged wallflower once used her skills in the kitchen to show up at a suitor&amp;#39;s doorstep wearing nothing but a fur coat and carrying a plate of freshly baked cookies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, in her unrated memoir, Lisa G. reveals all about her adventures and misadventures growing up and looking for love in all the wrong places. Her journey begins in the only place where she felt comfortable&amp;#8212;behind the microphone. Lisa became a workaholic with a larger-than-life radio personality. But when the &amp;#34;on air&amp;#34; lights switched off, she struggled to find her true self. Through therapy and some soul-searching, she transformed from an insecure young woman who attempted to win over men with her culinary prowess into an independent adult who finally learned to love herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lisa&amp;#39;s story is full of inspiration and lots of laughs. Smart, sassy, and stacked, Lisa always put her career first. While searching for the perfect job, the aspiring radio star dated her way through an urban bachelorette&amp;#39;s predictable gallery of potential mates. In &lt;em&gt;Sex, Lies, and Cookies&lt;/em&gt;, Lisa details her hilarious sexcapades, which include everyone from a nice Jewish doctor with a unique fetish to the classic unavailable type who wants an &amp;#34;open relationship.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lisa G. also shares behind-the-scenes stories from her A-list celebrity interviews, friendships, and time hanging with hip-hop royalty like P. Diddy, Will Smith, and Flavor Flav.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along the way, Lisa G. became known for having the hottest ticket in town&amp;#8212;entry into her exclusive and legendary cookie parties. The book includes the recipes for more than twenty-five of Lisa G.&amp;#39;s famous desserts, like &amp;#34;Losing my Cherry Cookies&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Double D-licious Oatmeal Cookies,&amp;#34; as well as tips for hosting your own fabulous cookie party. &lt;em&gt;Sex, Lies and Cookies&lt;/em&gt; is a tasty read that proves why the most satisfying relationship you&amp;#39;ll ever have starts with learning to love yourself (and how a little cookie dough can help).&lt;/p&gt;" />
