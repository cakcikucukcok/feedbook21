  <title>Legacy of My Father - Waverley Traylor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Waverley Traylor&lt;/b&gt; grew up knowing little about his fathers life or what made him tick. Yet like life itself, time breeds change. After his father was unable to obtain the Purple Heart medal for his service in World War II, Traylor embarked on a fascinating journey to not only prove his fathers qualifications, but also to learn more about his fathers true identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Legacy of My Father&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is the result of years of research by Traylor, who visited family and comrades around the nation, extensively read about World War II battles, and sorted through thousands of photographs, newspapers, and letters in order to accurately share his fathers compelling life story. Presented in three distinct periods, this biography describes his fathers childhood growing up in pre- and post-Depression America, where he became a well-adjusted youth with strong Christian values. Later, his father was drafted into the US Marines and sent to fight in one of the bloodiest battles in the history of the Corps; Traylor shares heartbreaking details how these events forever changed his fathers post war life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This moving biography shares the intriguing story of a courageous man haunted by war until his last days on Earth and honors the unique relationship he shared only with his son.&lt;/p&gt;" />
