  <title>Transforming the Faiths of Our Fathers - Ann Braude</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Pundits on both the right and the left often portray religion and feminism as inherently incompatible, as opposing forces in American culture. &lt;i&gt;Transforming the Faiths of Our Fathers&lt;/i&gt; seeks to dispel that notion by asking sixteen well-known religious figures to tell the story of how they became involved in the women&#39;s movement. Their work-much of it ongoing-has helped transform the way religion is practiced in this country. They have worked for the ordination of women, for inclusive language and liturgy, for new interpretations of scripture, theology, and religious law, and for an end to religious teachings that contributed to destructive gender stereotypes. Authors include Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, Muslim, Mormon, Evangelical, and goddess feminists. The personal stories of the fascinating contributors include watershed events in American religion and society over the last forty years. Each one of the women in&lt;i&gt;Transforming the Faiths of Our Fathers&lt;/i&gt; has made history and seen it made, and gives her own version of what she has witnessed and experienced. They demonstrate the roots of their feminist activism in religious commitments, and the significance of struggles within religious arenas for expanding women&#39;s possibilities in society and culture." />
