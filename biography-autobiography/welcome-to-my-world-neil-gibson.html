  <title>Welcome to My World - Neil Gibson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book was devised with a single intention: for people to understand
how the brain works.
Society, along with evolution, teaches us to rely mainly on the longterm
memory area of the brain, yet this can be the underlying cause of
many mental and physical problems. Welcome To My World has been
written in a deliberately simplistic way so that everyone can understand
it. Hopefully it might encourage you to question how you use your own
brain and challenge you to think in a very different way.
Whilst there are many books written by so-called experts about the
physiology and function of the brain, their authors rarely have personal
insight into how seemingly normal brain activity can impact negatively
on overall wellbeing, or how the brain can be re-trained with amazing
consequential benefi ts to health." />
