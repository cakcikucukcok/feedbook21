  <title>You Came into My Life - Kenny Bernard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In a different life, with different choices, I could have achieved fame and fortune, had a gold disc hanging from a wall or an Oscar on my mantelpiece.
But I have never been one for regrets. You make your choices, you have your share of luck and you only remember the good times. And boy, were there some good times.
I have been very fortunate in my life to play at some of the greatest stages in England and to meet some truly amazing stars. I have equally had just as much enjoyment playing intimate gigs and local venues.
I sometimes hear these famous songs on the radio or see these great names being interviewed and wondered whether that could have been me.
But had that happened, where would I be and who would I have become? I doubt very much I would be writing this book today. 
I have learnt from the bad times and loved having the good times.
I wouldnt have changed a thing." />
