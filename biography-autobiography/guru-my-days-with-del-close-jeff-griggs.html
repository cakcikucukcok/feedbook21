  <title>Guru: My Days with Del Close - Jeff Griggs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A legend of improvisational theater, Del Close is best known for discovering and cultivating the talents of John Belushi, Chris Farley, Bill Murray, Mike Myers, and countless other comedy giants. Jeff Griggs was a student of Close&#39;s at the ImprovOlympic in Chicago when he was asked to help the aging mentor (often in ill health) by driving him around the city on his weekly errands. The two developed a volatile friendship that shocked, angered, and amused both of them-and produced this hilarious and ultimately endearing chronicle of Close&#39;s last years. &quot;As Socrates was to learning, Lenin was to communism, and Al Sloan was to General Motors, so Del Close was the force that impelled Second City and Improv. Griggs&#39;s portrait is touching, funny and captures Del&#39;s essence beautifully.&quot;-Dan Aykroyd. Already optioned for a major motion picture." />
