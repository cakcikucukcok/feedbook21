  <title>The Greek House - Christian Brechneff, Tim Lovejoy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A richly rewarding narrative about a young painter&#39;s love affair with the Greek island of Sifnos&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Christian Brechneff first set foot on the Greek island of Sifnos, it was the spring of 1972 and he was a twenty-one-year-old painter searching for artistic inspiration and a quiet place to work. There, this Swiss child of Russian émigrés, adrift and confused about his sexuality, found something extraordinary. In Sifnos, he found a muse, a subject he was to paint for years, and a sanctuary.&lt;br&gt;     In &lt;i&gt;The Greek House&lt;/i&gt;, Brechneff tells a funny, touching narrative about his relationship to Sifnos, writing with warmth about its unforgettable residents and the house he bought in a hilltop farm village. This is the story of how he fell in love with Greece, and how it became a haven from the complexities of his life in Western Europe and New York. It is the story of his village and of the island during the thirty-odd years he owned the house--from a time when there were barely any roads, to the arrival of the modern world with its tourists and high-speed boats and the euro. And it is the story of the end of the love affair--how the island changed and he changed, how he discovered he had outgrown Sifnos, or couldn&#39;t grow there anymore.&lt;br&gt;     &lt;i&gt;The Greek House&lt;/i&gt; is a celebration of place and an honest narrative of self-discovery. In its pages, a naïve and inexperienced young man comes into his own. Weaving himself into the life of the island, painting it year after year, he finds a place he can call home.&lt;/p&gt;" />
