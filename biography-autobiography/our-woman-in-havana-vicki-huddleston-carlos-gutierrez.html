  <title>Our Woman in Havana - Vicki Huddleston, Carlos Gutierrez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;Our Woman in Havana chronicles the past several decades of US-Cuba relations from the  bird&#39;s-eye view of State Department veteran and longtime Cuba hand Vicki  Huddleston, our top diplomat in Havana under Presidents Clinton  and George W. Bush.After the US embassy in Havana was closed in  1961, relations between the two countries broke off. A thaw came in 1977, with the opening of a de facto embassy in Havana, the US Interests Section, where Huddleston would later serve. In her compelling memoir of a diplomat at work, she tells gripping stories of face-to-face encounters with Fidel Castro and the initiatives she undertook, like the transistor radios she furnished to ordinary Cubans. With inside accounts of many dramatic episodes, like the tumultuous Elián  González custody battle, Huddleston also evokes the charm of the island country, and her warm affection for the Cuban people.Uniquely qualified to explain the inner workings of US-Cuba relations, Huddleston examines the Obama administration&#39;s diplomatic opening of 2014, the mysterious &quot;sonic+?  brain and hearing injuries suffered by US and Canadian diplomats who were  serving in Havana, and the rescinding of the diplomatic opening under the Trump administration.Huddleston recounts missed opportunities for détente, and the myths, misconceptions, and lies that have long pervaded US-Cuba relations. With Raúl Castro scheduled to step down in 2018, she also peers into the future, when for the first time in more than six decades no one named Castro will be Cuba&#39;s leader.Our Woman in Havana is essential reading for everyone interested in Cuba, including the thousands of Americans visiting the island every year, observers who study the stormy relationship with our near neighbor, and policymakers navigating the nuances and challenges of the US-Cuba relationship.&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
