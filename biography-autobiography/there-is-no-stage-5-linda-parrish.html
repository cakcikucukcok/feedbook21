  <title>There Is No Stage 5 - Linda Parrish</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As a survivor of a rare Stage 4 Cancer, I felt moved to tell my story in hopes it may inspire others going through this illness, or their caretakers. Share my happier times as a kid in New York, moving to Kansas City, Missouri, then on to Lenexa, Kansas.
I had two incidents that should have claimed my life, and one that should have claimed my husband&#39;s. I figure we were saved for a reason; perhaps to touch people in a way that was helpful and heartfelt.
This is basically a condensed version of my life - the good with the bad, the happy with the sad. You will be with me every step of the way during my bout with the devil.
It has been close to five years since I have been in remission, and look forward to every birthday and Relay for Life event.
Two months before publishing, my sainted mother passed away. This is the only picture I have of me during my entire ordeal ( and bald ).
*I wanted to do something to give back, so a portion of the proceeds will be donated to the Leukemia-Lymphoma Society and Cancer Action of Overland Park, Kansas." />
