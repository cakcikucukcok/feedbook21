  <title>Fatal Illusion - Luz Garcia</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I wrote this book aiming to wake up the conscience of the youth who had fallen
prey in the jaws of a beast called La vida loca.
&lt;/br&gt;It is world of fatal illusion scandalized by Holywood and rap music, giving the
impression that you can achieve anything you have dreamt of without having to
face the consequences that La vida loca leaves behind.
&lt;/br&gt;This is the story of my life, as I was 28 years old and believed I had the world on my
feet. I never imagined waking up from this fatal illusion in the dark city, La crcel,
where I spent the last 28 years of my life. If, after reading this story, you still want to
continue the journey of La vida loca, then you will surely end up in one of three
destinations: The hospital, the prison and the cemetery Where would you want
to go?
&lt;/br&gt;At least God gave me the opportunity to live to tell it, the majority have left with
their stories onto eternity." />
