  <title>Fun at the Telephone Company - Chuck Bozue</title>
      <meta name="description" content="During my lifetime, I noted that people, particularly men, love to tell stories about their life experiences. If you know a fireman or policeman well enough, you know that they can entertain for hours by relating their on-the-job experiences. Even mundane occupations are settings for good stories. Having worked at a telephone company for thirty-two years, I had my share of experiences. I share them with my friends and family. Sooner or later, someone suggested writing a book. Not a classic, but rather one of those bathroom novels loaded with short stories. Thats what you will find here. However bizarre, they are all true. Of course the names were changed to protect my buddies and me who did and said some incredibly stupid and sometimes dangerous things. In some cases, the company policies and procedures I write about may not be depicted as they actually were. Ive attempted to depict them as the field foremen, technicians, and I perceived them.
You will have many laughs and more than a few Ive been there moments along the way. The telephone company wasnt my whole life, so I threw in a few personal and family stories along the way. Hopefully between work and home, these stories will give you background on the real telephone company and also a seemingly directionless individual who was successful because of both." />
