  <title>They Served the Devil&#39;s Brood - Warwick Howard Grace</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In 1135, during the civil conflict between the usurper King Stephen and Empress Matilda (the daughter of Henry I), two cousins, Raymond and William (unavoidably, one of the many Williams in the story), are born and raised at Carew, in southwest Wales. Their growth through infancy to maturity becomes an important part of the theme of They Served the Devils Brood.
It is a critical time in England and Wales as the barons are torn between loyalty to either faction, as well as having to deal with an increase in Welsh opposition to their presence. Calls are also being made for their knights and vassals to join the crusade against the infidels, who have taken control of the Holy Land. 
Henry Plantagenet, the son of Matilda, enters the fray as a youth but has to be content to wait till Stephen, bereft of a viable heir, agrees to name Henry as his successor.
The Welsh Church is also facing increased demands from the centralized hierarchy of Rome. 
As Henry II takes over the reins of government, his influence on all involved becomes apparent. He is kept busyand with him, all his servantstravelling his domains in France and England.
An exiled minor Irish king appeals to Henry to help him recover his rightful place and territory. He is given permission to gather such help as he can from the Norman-Welsh barons. Richard de Clare (Strongbow)rather down on his luck at the timeresponds. 
It takes some time, but with Raymonds help, plus that of Raymonds relations, the FitzGeralds, they invade the southeast corner of Ireland. Raymond proves to be a capable warrior and brilliant commander but has to struggle with his own troubles as he seeks the hand of the higher-born sister of Richard, Basilia de Clare." />
