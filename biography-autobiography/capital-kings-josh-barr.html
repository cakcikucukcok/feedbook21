  <title>Capital Kings - Josh Barr</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The President might live at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue in the heart of Washington, D.C., but in the nation&#39;s capital, there is no question that basketball is king.
   For more than half a century, local standouts have gotten in their run, first at the local playgrounds and now in air conditioned gyms. And for just as long the debate has raged: Who are the best players to come out of this fertile basketball ground?
   The conversation dates back to Elgin Baylor and Dave Bing, who starred at Spingarn High in the 1950s and eventually were selected to the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History when the league celebrated its 50th anniversary in 1996.
   Then there were standouts like Adrian Dantley and Danny Ferry of DeMatha High in the 1970s and 1980s, respectively, and Grant Hill at South Lakes in the 1990s. The first decade of the new century brought Montrose Christian phenom Kevin Durant, who already has put together a splendid career in a short time.
   Throughout the years, the discussion has remained fervent, as local hoops aficionados wonder where each sensation belongs on the list of Capital Kings. This book attempts to sort things out." />
