  <title>Wanderlust - Jane Pearce</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is the true story of my quest to live as a free spirit for a year of my life, mentally, physically and sexually. The year is 1975, I was 24 and I had abandoned a marriage and walked away from a secure job as a BBC make-up artist. Where in the modern world would I find the wide open horizons that I sought? How would I live? Would I share the adventure?
The ocean, a boat and an open relationship provided my answers.
Travelling with no fixed itinerary, no advance reservations, no return ticket and no fixed destination. We became true free spirits open to the dictionarys definition of adventure: one who lives on his wits. Risk. A remarkable happening.&#39;
My mood was at odds with the rest of the country. After the previous years three day week, strikes and Harold Wilsons minority government, Britain was bracing itself for Denis Healeys tough new budget. I was about to sail away from all this, but what lay ahead could be much worse and certainly carried more risk. Restless, excited, optimistic and definitely naive I did it anyway. There is a phrase, &quot;be careful what you wish for as it might come true&quot;" />
