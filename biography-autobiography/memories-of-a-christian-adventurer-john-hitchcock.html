All readers will find comfort in the acceptance and easiness to relate to his stories. The stories of adventure, danger, deliverance, and the unseen hand of God in Johns life will keep you engaged.

Readers will cry as they turn each page as they become Johns friend and feel his pain as they discover his heartaches and setbacks, but will smile as they learn that all things happen for a reason. Read the story of a classic romance that will give others hope in the low times of their lives. There is a story for everyone, from young to aged, I dare you to enter Johns world and quickly become a friend of his literature  Charlene Hitchcock, daughter.&lt;/p&gt;
