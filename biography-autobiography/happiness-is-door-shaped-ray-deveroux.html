  <title>Happiness is Door Shaped - Ray Deveroux</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Prisons, a community within a community. Violence is everywhere, the smell of fear is around every corner, you need, no must have eyes in the back of your head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No time to relax, no time to sit back with a brew and put your feet up, the Prison won&amp;rsquo;t let you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever wondered what goes on behind those Prison walls? What really goes on behind those big unforgiving gates?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ray Deveroux worked within the Prison walls for nearly 25 years, the violence, self-harm, suicides, bullying, taxing, rapes, sadness, hopelessness and yes, now and again the humour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ray tells the story of his own experiences, in his own words, some of it is upsetting to read, some of it will shock you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story will take you through his own early stages of joining the Prison service to the day Ray hangs his keys up for good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is a must should you wish to join up as an Officer, Probation officer, want to work in a prison in any capacity or if you are curious of what Prison life is really like.&lt;/p&gt;" />
