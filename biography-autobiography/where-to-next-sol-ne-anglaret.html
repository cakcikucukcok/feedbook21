A testament that life shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be lived trying to &amp;lsquo;keep up with the Joneses&amp;rsquo;, but rather, listening to your instinctual gut feeling and following your own individual path.

From childhood to adulthood, country after country, follow her footsteps, witness her joy, pain and life-changing moments. Reading this book will give you a boost and leave you positive, driven and energised.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joanne Profeta &amp;ndash; France, Norway&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Living through the writer&amp;#39;s adventures was pure entertainment!
