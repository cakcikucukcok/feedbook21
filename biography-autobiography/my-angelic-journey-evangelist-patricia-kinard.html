  <title>My Angelic Journey - Evangelist Patricia Kinard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For many years, evangelist Patricia Kinard lived a life of illusions. She soon realized that life wasnt about her plans, but rather those of the Father, who defines a purpose for every situation. In My Angelic Journey, Kinard narrates her journey after she discovered the true purpose God had for her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this memoir, she details her transformation from a child with a measure of faith into a teenager with increased faith, and finally into a mature woman with undoubting faith who was blessed with a vision and later instructed to become an evangelist. It shows how her trials and physical and emotional losses were replaced by joy when she put her faith and trust in God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A powerful, firsthand testimony, My Angelic Journey offers a look into the life of a sinner who, after receiving a call from God, walked from a life of darkness into one of glorious light. It shares the story of one woman, chosen by God, who now guides others into a life of prosperity, dignity, love, and goodness based on a Christian foundation.&lt;/p&gt;" />
