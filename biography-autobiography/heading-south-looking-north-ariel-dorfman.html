  <title>Heading South, Looking North - Ariel Dorfman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ariel dorfman has been hailed as one of the &quot;greatest living Latin American novelists&quot; &lt;i&gt;(Newsweek)&lt;/i&gt; and a &quot;storyteller of almost mythic intensity&quot; &lt;i&gt;(The Financial Times)&lt;/i&gt;.  In his brilliant memoir, &lt;i&gt;Heading South, Looking North&lt;/i&gt;, Dorfman explores the many exiles of a life torn, from age two, between the United States and Latin America, between revolution and repression.  Interwoven with the remarkable story of how he switched languages and cultures--not once, but three times--is a day-by-day account of his multiple escapes from death during a military takeover in Chile.  Dorfman filters these events through his dual and hybrid life, speaking, reading, thinking at times in Spanish, at times in English.  Beautifully written and deeply moving, &lt;i&gt;Heading South, Looking North&lt;/i&gt; is at once a vivid account of a life as complex and mysterious as the fictional characters Dorfman creates and an enthralling meditation about true personal conviction and courage in the late twentieth century.&lt;/p&gt;" />
