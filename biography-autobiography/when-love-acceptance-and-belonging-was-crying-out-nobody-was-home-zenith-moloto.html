      <meta name="description" content="Firstly Im deeply thankful to Christ my Lord and Saviour who Inspired,
Challenged and Encouraged me to write this Book of my Life. When Love,
Acceptance and Belonging was Crying out Nobody was Home secondly
I would like to thank this truly amazing, spectacular woman of God my Mentor
Aunt Nancy Moloto my younger sister. She has been with me through it all
when I was living in the horrible nightmares of my past and mentored me to
climb the ladder and live a clear blue sky bright future.
And I honestly Truly believe that this book will help and relate to every single
one of you, guide and teach you to open up to the possibility of forgiveness,
moving forward and starting over, living a life without limits.
The greatest impact youll ever make is that you should not suffer the past.
You should be able to wear it like a loose garment, take it off and let it drop.
It all starts with you." />
