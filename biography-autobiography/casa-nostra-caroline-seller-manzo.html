A large, eccentric, and loving clan living in a magnificent, crumbling villa, Santa Maria, the Manzos welcomed Caroline warmly, and soon she and Marcello were married. Together they traveled the world and started a family, but through it all, Santa Maria was never far from their thoughts. So when the Manzo brothers united to save the family&#39;s deteriorating estate, Marcello and Caroline eagerly signed on to the project&amp;#8212;not entirely prepared for what they were getting into!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As seen through the eyes of Caroline Seller Manzo&amp;#8212;an outsider who is often surprised and always delighted by her Italian family and adopted hometown&amp;#8212;&lt;em&gt;Casa Nostra&lt;/em&gt; is the captivating story of a villa&#39;s difficult, glorious rebirth and a celebration of the unique beauty and history of western Sicily and its people.&lt;/p&gt;" />
