&lt;P&gt;You will find out why furniture manufacturing in the Piedmont area of North Carolina was important in the author&#39;s life and the state of North Carolina.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Depression era modes of transportation and communication come alive from her excellent descriptions.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Due to a family incident religion&#39;s decline and eventual rejection unfolds slowly.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;Terms used in local government reminds the reader that North Carolina was one of the original thirteen colonies and was settled from east to west.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Public school education in her college town was so important the citizens paid extra tax for city schools. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The end of World War II brought peace time production of everything.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;College and an education career as well as marriage led to the birth of a son and a move to Florida.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;More education in North Carolina and a return to Florida for the son&#39;s education was interspersed with a new marriage.&lt;/P&gt;
