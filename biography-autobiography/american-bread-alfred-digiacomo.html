  <title>American Bread - Alfred DiGiacomo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Most learn of the struggle of immigrants during the early twentieth century through the impersonal analysis of secondary sources.  Viewing these times through the eyes of author, Alfred DiGiacomo provides a rare personal glimpse of life for an Italian immigrant family during this time.
      He brings us back to a small village in southern Italy called San Giorgio, Albanese - the birthplace of his parents - and gives us a glimpse of life within their village.  We learn of his father, Francesco, and his journey to America, his service in World War I, and his return visit to Italy where he met and married his wife. Settling in Huntington Station, New York, the couple began their lives together during the Roaring Twenties and face, with their growing family, the hardships of the Great Depression of the thirties.
   Mr. DiGiacomo describes everyday life - his schooling, work, and activities -while growing up as an Italian American in the small close-knit town.  In doing so, he tells of the experience of all immigrants, who arrive during a period of transition and turmoil and whose sacrifice and determination allow the seed of hope for a new life to grow." />
