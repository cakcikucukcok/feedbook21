  <title>God&#39;s Mimic - Carol Ferguson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;
&quot;Mommy, the angels are coming for me,&quot; toddler Hazel Page cried out as
she drifted between life and death, the result of a ruptured appendix.
Her parents prayed fervently. &quot;Lord, if you have a plan for Hazel&#39;s
life, please spare her.&quot;
&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
&quot;Mommy, the angels have gone away to heaven again.&quot; God did have a plan
for her life and this was only the first of several encounters Hazel
would have with angels throughout her life.
&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
Born and raised in Saskatchewan, Hazel attended Saskatoon Bible College
and trained as a midwife at Bethany Hospital in Saskatoon. While
attending the Summer Institute of Linguistics sponsored by Wycliffe
Bible Translators it was revealed to Hazel that she could mimic anything
she heard and write it down phonetically. She was &lt;b&gt;God&#39;s Mimic&lt;/b&gt;. Yes, she
did translation work but she also pulled teeth, delivered babies, set
broken legs and dug graves.
&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
Hazel&#39;s missionary career took her to Mexico with Wycliffe, then China
and the Philippines with China Inland Mission/Overseas Missionary
Fellowship. For many years her home was a thatched hut in a jungle
village.
&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
Her goal in life was to introduce people to Christ and then put God&#39;s
Word in their hands so they would know His will. This is the story of a
unique woman, sold out to God.
