  <title>A Baby Boomer&#39;s Guide to &quot;I Remember When . . . &quot; - Dr. Bill Reid</title>
      <meta name="description" content="SELF IMPROVEMENT&lt;P&gt;
Remember dad saying that he had it so bad he walked fi ve miles
uphill to school both ways? Well, its time for us baby boomers
to make sure our kids know how life was for us when we
were growing up in a life before Facebook, Twitter, microwaves,
and color TV. This whimsical book takes us back in time and clearly
demonstrates exactly how life was for baby boomers. Can you imagine
having to leave the couch to change the channel on the TV? Can you?
We baby boomers can.&lt;I&gt; Sheesh.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;P&gt;
Short and succinct, The Baby Boomers Guide will allow boomers to
remember growing up, allow the grandchildren to listen in wonder,
and give the children another opportunity to roll their eyes the way
they did in high school when they knew everything.
Guaranteed to bring a smile to a boomers
face, or the author will offer a deep apology.&lt;P&gt;
