      <meta name="description" content="Adoptees can have a picture-perfect upbringing with their adoptive parents, and yet still feel the need to find their roots; its a naturalmaybe even primalneed. Adoptive parents, if still alive, should not feel threatened by this desire; it is a testament that they have raised a well-rounded child.

Many, if not most, adoptees search for their biological mothers first. This is understandable because of the maternal bond. In some cases, this search leads to a dead end for one reason or another. In the beginning, when the author was asked if she wanted to find her biological father, she was reluctant. This was because she was deeply hurt by her mothers decision to not allow contact with her, even though she tried to rationalize her thinking. 
She decided to go ahead with the search for her biological fatherone of the best decisions she feels she has ever made. &lt;i&gt;He Waited for Me&lt;/i&gt; tells the story of her search and its results, presenting an inspiring story of hope and joy." />
