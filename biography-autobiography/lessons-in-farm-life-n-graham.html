  <title>Lessons in Farm Life - N. Graham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is composed of stories related to the many experiences the author and her husband have gone through as hobby farmers over the past several years. Lessons in Farm Life includes tales of cows, sheep, turkeys, chickens, dogs, and horses. About twenty years ago, we started out as novices, and through the years we have learned many lessons about living life on a farm. Author Nancy Grahams original purpose in writing this book was to have something tangiblewith life experiences and spiritual lessonsin order to pass down to her family. As she got further on in the writing process and began relating the many spiritual applications that could be taken from these stories, she realized the book could be a great encouragement to many Christians. This is especially true considering the traumatic and heart-wrenching  events that took place  within the family  before the writing of this book was complete.&lt;/p&gt;" />
