  <title>Scenes and Adventures in the Army - Philip St. George Cooke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Scenes and Adventures in the Army: Or, Romance of Military Life was first published in 1857.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Cooke, then a lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Army, described his extensive military service on the American frontier and included a detailed account of the various Native American tribes he encountered there. A West Point graduate and a lawyer, Cooke fought in both the Black Hawk War (1832) and the Mexican War (1846&amp;ndash;1848).&lt;br /&gt;
In addition, he helped to protect settlers on the Oregon Trail, fought Apache in New Mexico Territory, helped subdue Sioux in Nebraska Territory, helped restore order in Bloody Kansas, and led a thousand-mile march from Fort Leavenworth to Salt Lake City in an expedition against the Mormons in Utah Territory.&lt;br /&gt;
In his memoir Cooke waxed poetic about the western landscape and its native peoples, finding both superior to the Europeans&amp;#39; &amp;quot;romance of ruins&amp;quot; and their love of &amp;quot;sonorous titles.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Philip St. George Cooke (1809&amp;ndash;1895) was a career United States Army cavalry officer who served as a Union General in the American Civil War. He is noted for his authorship of an Army cavalry manual, and is sometimes called the &amp;quot;Father of the U.S. Cavalry.&amp;quot; His service in the Civil War was significant, but was eclipsed in prominence by the contributions made by his famous son in law, J.E.B. Stuart, to the Confederate States Army." />
