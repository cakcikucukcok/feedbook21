  <title>Scipio Africanus - Alexander Acimovic</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Scipio Africanus was one of the greatest generals and statesmen of the Ancient World. When he was 18, he saved his father&#39;s life in battle during the Second Punic War and later survived the horrific Roman defeat at Cannae.&lt;/P&gt;
At the age of 26, he was named Commander-in-Chief of the Roman army in Spain and in 4 years, by daringly storming the city of Cartagena and crushing two Carthaginian armies in battle, conquered almost the entire peninsula for Rome.&lt;/P&gt;
After returning to Rome, he leveraged popular support to gain command of an army to invade Carthage. Lacking logistical and material support, he welded, trained and armed a battle-hardened army. Landing in Africa, he delivered a stunning defeat to the Carthaginians with a surprise attack by night and fire. After the famed Hannibal Barca returned to defend his homeland, Scipio and his army utterly defeated the Punic general at the Battle of Zama.&lt;/P&gt;
This book, based on exhaustive research of both ancient and modern sources, describes Scipio&#39;s life and career in detail, analyzes his military and political strategies and decisions, and illustrates the timelessness of his leadership skills and far-seeing diplomacy.&lt;/P&gt;" />
