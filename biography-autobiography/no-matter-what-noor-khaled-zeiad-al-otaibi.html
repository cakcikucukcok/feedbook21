  <title>No Matter What - Noor Khaled Zeiad Al Otaibi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="To understand and to keep feeling your self-satisfaction in a high level, you should share your story, especially if its worth to talk about regardless of the reactions you may receive. I have decided to start writing as Im writing on a regular basis on my Facebook wall and I got plenty of likes for my notes. My writing skills have been improved steadily due to reading many books. In most of my leisure time, I tend to complete one book at least. Most of my writing is about motivation quotes, about not giving up despite the hard and aggressive life we live. Beside this, people in general have a sense of curiosity. They are so eager to know what occurred to you if there is something from their perspective to ask. As long as my confidence is reflected in my attitude as well as my personality, ultimately I dont have any objection to tell them what happened to me and how proud I am of myself. Without this tough experience, we may not meet or they may not even know me. Therefore, I do welcome all of you, my beloved friends, to join me. My journey might help and give insightful meaning for people who apparently need to perceive life in a way to thank God for every single thing." />
