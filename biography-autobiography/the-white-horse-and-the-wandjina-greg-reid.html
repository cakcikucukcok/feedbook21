  <title>The White Horse and the Wandjina - Greg Reid</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Greg Reid shares lessons learned as a cowboy/stockman, radio announcer, and writer in Queensland, Australia, in this memoir.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;On a cattle ranch growing up, he came to understand that riding horses is much like negotiating life. Once a horse bucked him off in a certain way, he learned that lesson. Its like that in life, too: We have the opportunity to learn from our mistakes.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A constant theme is his love for Christ, who he did not give himself to fully until 1989, when he had an out-of-body experience at Kurramine Beach, traveling back to the night when Judas betrayed Christ in the Garden of Gethsemane. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;He confesses to being both a healer and a sinnersomething that took him nearly a lifetime to figure out but that has helped him discover Christ, change his life, and help others.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Join the author as he acknowledges his frailties, explores other dimensions, and reveals how God and spirituality interact with the culture of indigenous Australia in &lt;i&gt;The White Horse and the Wandjina.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/P&gt;" />
