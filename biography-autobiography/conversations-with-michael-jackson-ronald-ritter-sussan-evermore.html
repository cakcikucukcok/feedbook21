  <title>Conversations With Michael Jackson - Ronald Ritter, Sussan Evermore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Michael Jackson is one of the most recognizable and iconic figures of the twentieth century. A musical genius with each period of his life identifiable by its own creative ground breaking style.
Accusations of child abuse and court cases came and went. His children were born and he began a slow retirement into an older Michael. However this was not to be the end of Michael&#39;s career as 2009 brought him a whole new possibility to rectify his financial decline, signing to perform fifty plus tour dates in England and Europe.
Unexpectedly Michael died on 25th June 2009 aged fifty, three weeks prior to the commencement of his &#39;This Is It&#39; tour in England and Europe. 
So much has been written about Michael&#39;s life that most of the facts are available to view, what remains are the unanswered questions to his life.
Who killed Michael Jackson?
Who are the real mother and father of Michael&#39;s children?
We will give you all the answers from the source." />
