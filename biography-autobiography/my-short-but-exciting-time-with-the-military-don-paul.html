  <title>My Short (But Exciting) Time with the Military - Don Paul</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; The narrative takes you through three years with the Ohio Air National Guard starting in 1947 when the author was seventeen years of age. The author takes you along with him on his flying adventures with the Air Guard. This unit, the 112&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Bomb Squadron (L), was equipped with Douglas B-26 Invaders. These light bombers were real hot rods for their day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; He takes you along on three Summer Encampments prior to the 112&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; being activated and taken into the United States Air Force in 1950. This was the result of the hostilities that broke out in Korea in June of 1950.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The Air Guard really didnt prepare the author for life in the active military. But he learned and survived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The story initially takes you to Lawson Field, which is the air field attached to Fort Benning, GA. There the 112&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; became part of the 117th Photo Reconnaissance Wing and the aircraft became RB-26s. Then, in 1951, the author was transferred up to Langley Field, VA where he became a member of the Armament Section of the 154&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Fighter/Bomber Squadron, part of the 136&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Fighter Bomber Wing. This unit was equipped with Republic F-84 Thunderjets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; From there it was on to the west coast by train and subsequently to Japan and Korea by plane, exciting modes of travel in those days. Experience life, as it was, in the Air Force in a rear area combat zone.&lt;/p&gt;" />
