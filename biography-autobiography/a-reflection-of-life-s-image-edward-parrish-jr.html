  <title>A Reflection of Life’S Image - Edward Parrish Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="We often hold a different view of ourselves than what we project to others. But it is during times of inner reflection that we see the truth of our being, for better or worse. 
Instead of fearing the exposure of our true self, we should embrace it and fully appreciate the depth and breadth of our character.&lt;p&gt;
A Reflection of Lifes Image explores the unique relationships we have not only with our inner spirit, but also with the spirits of those around us. Through vivid imagery and stunning verse, Edward Parrish Jr. brilliantly captures how we as humans hide our true selves, yet secretly long to reveal our real personalities.&lt;p&gt;
Parrishs poetry uses images of nature to convey human emotions, thoughts, and actions. In his title poem, Reflections, Parrish compares a flower to a soft-spoken word while Learning uses autumn to create a colorful composition that exposes the moments of nature as it surrounds us. In addition, Parrish examines the seasons of life with those of nature, crafting a lasting tribute to this intricate connection.&lt;p&gt;
With a gift for translating emotion onto the page, Parrish has created a deeply moving poetry collection filled with depth. A Reflection of Lifes Image will fill your mind with peace and open your heart to the human condition." />
