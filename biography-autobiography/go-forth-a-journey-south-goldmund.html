  <title>Go Forth: A Journey South - Goldmund</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Go Forth chronicles a transformation. The biggest life-changing journey of my adulthood. Throughout 2014 I felt the pull to travel south-down to Mexico. The adventures that were had, the women that were seduced, and the revelations that were revealed all combined to stir my spirit and document those moments in a 150 page book. In it, there are very detailed descriptions of my game, routines, nuances and attitude that were used to successfully bed over a dozen women in just over a month. It also includes the beginning of the trip spent in New Orleans, experimenting with the nightlife and honing my camera game into a lethal weapon. Most importantly, the book captures an attitude that every player should hope to develop. An attitude that sees the world for what it is: chooses to focus on the beauty, acknowledge the evil, and ignore the mundane. Story telling and examples have always been the best way to teach and learn. They are the oldest forms of communication and education. Much more than any game textbook I could have written, Go Forth captures the spirit of what it takes to be a successful player. Come along for the journey...&lt;/p&gt;" />
