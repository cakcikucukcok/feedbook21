  <title>Return to Fort Apache - Tom Walker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;More than thirty years ago, Tom Walker published &lt;i&gt;Fort Apache: New Yorks Most Violent Precinct&lt;/i&gt;, introducing the world to the 4-1, a South Bronx precinct that was home to more murders than the entire city of San Francisco. To this day, his story about life as police lieutenant in the 4-1 precinct remains the definitive account of the vicious cycle of violence that griped urban America in the late twentieth century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The battle between criminals and law enforcement did not end in 1971, but massive controversy over the books publication precluded the release of a sequeluntil now. With &lt;i&gt;Return to Fort Apache: Memoir of an NYPD Captain&lt;/i&gt;, Walker finally tells the rest of his fascinating life story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Return to Fort Apache&lt;/i&gt; was written to counter the prevailing politically correct opinion that the officers in Fort Apache used their weapons first and their wits last. In addition, Walker hopes to memorialize the courageous officers he served with in the 4-1, to remember forever their sacrifices, their courage, and their daily brushes with death and violence.&lt;/p&gt;" />
