  <title>Stick with Me and You’Ll Be Wearing Diamonds - Nancy Anne Lockwood</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This story is about a woman who suffers from bipolar / manic depressive disorder. The book takes you through her tormented childhood with a stressful life. The author uses music to write, and the words are some of the greatest lyrics ever written. The character portrayed is a real-life woman, who is threatened with permanent hospitalization and fights to come back to reality. She has had many lovers, but the one who means the most is someone who has recently died of cancer. The story depicts her feelings about his death and the fact that she believes he is guiding her to write this novel.
Michael Jackson and the character of her lover died within two weeks of each other. The author uses many of Michael Jacksons songs to write, as well as Frank Sinatras.
The book is like a tug-of-war between the author and the family of a very talented woman. The author has been writing since the age of seven but does not publish a single thing until she is 72.
You must read the book carefully to really understand its meaning. The author uses music to express her innermost thoughts. She is a good Catholic, who had fallen away, and she comes back for Gods help." />
