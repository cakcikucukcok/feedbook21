  <title>Madame Chiang Kai-shek: China&#39;s Eternal First Lady - Laura Tyson Li</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Now in paperback,&lt;I&gt; Madame Chiang Kai-shek&lt;/I&gt; is the first biography of one of history&amp;#8217;s most intriguing and controversial political figures. Beautiful, brilliant, and captivating, Madame Chiang Kai-shek seized unprecedented power during China&amp;#8217;s long and violent civil war. She passionately argued against Chinese Communism in the international arena and influenced decades of Sino-American relations and modern Chinese history. Raised in one of China&amp;#8217;s most powerful families and educated at Wellesley College, Soong Mayling went on to become wife, chief adviser, interpreter, and propagandist to Nationalist leader Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek. She sparred with international leaders like Churchill and Roosevelt, and impressed Westerners and Chinese alike with her acumen, charm, and glamour. But she was also decried as a manipulative &amp;#147;Dragon Lady,&amp;#8221; and despised for living in American-style splendor while Chinese citizens suffered under her husband&amp;#8217;s brutal oppression. The result of years of extensive research in the United States and abroad, and written with access to previously classified CIA and diplomatic files, &lt;I&gt;Madame Chiang Kai-shek&lt;/I&gt; objectively evaluates one of the most powerful and fascinating women of the twentieth century.&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
