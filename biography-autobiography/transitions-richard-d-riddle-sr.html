  <title>Transitions - Richard D. Riddle Sr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Transitions is a primer to spiritual and universal understanding.  It brings the reader closer to understanding of why we are here along with the roles of God, Angels, and negative forces.  Transitions is unique in its presentation as its focus is on self improvement.  To understand and love self opens the doors to love without condition.   
From the moment God creates a person, the energy of life begins.  Each energy follows a path of transitions, from spirit to flesh and flesh to spirit.  In our human existence the memories of our beginning are blocked in order that we can follow our human journey.  To understand our purpose in life is difficult, yet that understanding lies deep within us and if we seek it with a clear heart and mind it can be revealed.
Longmont, Colorado  There is no way that others could tell how to live ones life or suggest that he or she should do what they have done.  Thats why author Nathaniel writes about his own life and experiences, hoping that this will inspire readers to want to further investigate their own life and destiny.
God will never forsake you because He loves you. God doesnt change.  God is forever.  Thats what Transitions: A Spiritual Evolution is about.  The author presents the experiences of his life as a backdrop to see how God always helps and supports us in our earthly journey.  He addresses the meaning of spirituality, angelic messages, positive and negative influences and Gods unconditional love.  Discussed are the angelic sequence 8-2-8, transitions, and how the receipt of this powerful message has inspired him to take a new look at his spiritual journey.  He discovers that truth exists as a function of truth, not common belief, and that we do not need to look into the ancient past to hear Gods voice or see or hear his angels in our presence.  The author addresses these complex topics in order to gain a better understanding of who we are, why we exist, why there is pain and suffering in the world, and how to achieve ultimate happiness.   
Today, he looks back and reflects on all that has happened in his life and, with a critical eye and heart, digs deep within to see that God has always been by his side, responding to his needs as only God can. He invites everyone to reflect on the miracles of their own lives." />
