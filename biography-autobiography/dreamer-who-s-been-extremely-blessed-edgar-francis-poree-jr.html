  <title>Dreamer Who’S Been Extremely Blessed - Edgar Francis Poree Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Edgar Frances Poree Jr., a lifelong resident of Louisiana, looks back at his struggles, disappointments, and successes in this memoir that examines the African American experience in the South.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;As a Black male, he dealt with deeply rooted prejudices, religious discrimination, and conflict with older members of the Black community. He constantly faced inner turmoil, but he remained steadfast in his focus to achieve his goals and navigate the transition from segregation to integration.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Poree learned to be resourceful early, convincing the owner of a nearby grocery store to give him a job cleaning the store and organizing the shelves. He went on to start his own business polishing hardwood floors while in the seventh grade. His love for music eventually helped him earn a scholarship at Xavier University in New Orleans, and from there he was on his way.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;From his teaching career to his successes as a business executive and civic leader, Poree shares his memories of real people, real places, and real divisions. His hope is that youll be emboldened, encouraged and inspired to achieve your own dreams.&lt;/P&gt;" />
