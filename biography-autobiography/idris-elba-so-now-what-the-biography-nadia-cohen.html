But what of the man himself? In this, the only biography of the onscreen legend, Nadia Cohen reveals Elba&#39;s life behind the lens, exploring what makes him so ambitious, adaptable and endlessly watchable. His charisma has won him admirers on both sides of the Atlantic, and the role of Bond may yet beckon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So now what, Idris?&lt;/p&gt;" />
