  <title>My Boogie Board Ride to Denmark - Tedd Wallace</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Hanging on to my boogie board, I felt the riptide swirl me around. It relentlessly smashed me against the rocks and sucked me below the surface. I knew within minutes, I was going to die. Then came a God-given moment of elation as I was snatched from the churning seas by a native of St. Croix Virgin Island as he risked his life to reach down and pull me out.
My joy was soon shattered by the gut-wrenching moment when I learned that another man from Denmark had perished in his valiant attempt to rescue me. He swam to me earlier without hesitation but had disappeared in the riptide.
The intense drama continues on the sharp-edged lava rock cliff, as several people arrive to place themselves in harm way and finish rescuing me literally by their fingertips. So now comes the face-to-face moment with being met at the base of the cliff by an amazing lady of elegance, strength, and compassion. This new widow from Denmark exhibited the grandeur of a forgiving Danish society and their love for all mankind. This was the beginning of my boogie board ride to Denmark." />
