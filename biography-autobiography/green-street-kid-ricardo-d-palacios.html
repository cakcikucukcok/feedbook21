  <title>Green Street Kid - Ricardo D. Palacios</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Growing up on Green Street in Laredo, Texas, Ricardo Palacios made the wilderness his playground. The woods, the nearby creek, and the vastness of Chacon Creek Canyon transported him and his young friends away from the strife and poverty of the barrio and into the splendor of nature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back on his life, Palacios reflects on seventy years of memoriesfrom his birth through his days at the all-male St. Josephs Academy Catholic school, capturing the powerful camaraderie he shared with his classmates and his experiences playing high school football. He next takes a hard look at his college years, during which he flunked out twice before finally making the commitment to graduate with honors and obtain a law degree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palacios places his life experiences under a microscope, sharing periods of heavy alcohol use, very stressful years as a rookie attorney, and tales from the trenches about the pitfalls, successes, and failures of his legal practice. He describes his twenty-eight-year marriage, pondering how and why it failed, and tells of wonderful years raising his children on a cattle ranch, with plenty of opportunities for hunting and camping. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Green Street Kid is more than the story of one mans life. It is a portrait of the life and culture of South Texas, where the majority of the population is Hispanic and conflicts sometimes develop between Hispanics and Anglos. It is a story of falling down and rising up again.&lt;/p&gt;" />
