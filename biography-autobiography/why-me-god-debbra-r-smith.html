  <title>Why Me, God? - Debbra R. Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;During my early years, I thought intuition was how I knew things would come about, until one day I began to hear His strong voice. He warned me of life-altering events that would occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In life we expect to have trials to learn from, and pain is a form of that. I could not understand why my life consisted of constant pain, physically, emotionally, and even the most horrible, tragic pain ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite living this life, I enjoyed raising my three beautiful daughters. They were very different. My oldest was the studious one, my youngest was very independent, and my middle daughter was very loving and emotional. As they grew and became teenagers, my middle daughter, Brandi, would begin her life of living my pain. This was the beginning of her life of destruction. She was living in a secret world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through all these painful trials, God was always there for us. You will be amazed by His miracles as He lived in our lives every day. God told me to write this book so you can see beyond our life of pain. You will be astounded by the blessings given during my darkest hours and get a glimpse through His vision. God loves us so much and shares our deep grief. You are blessed with His ultimate love. He sacrificed His Son for us.&lt;/p&gt;" />
