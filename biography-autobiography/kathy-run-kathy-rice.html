  <title>Kathy Run - Kathy Rice</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Kathy&#39;s heartwarming story begins in 1961 where she lives in a prairie home in Northeastern Montana near Four Buttes. Five-year-old Kathy is the youngest of 5 children in the post World War II era, and the story is the charming tale of a little girl growing up in the love and security of her family and community, the exciting times of calving, planting, harvesting, and trips to town. She eludes to Laura Ingall&#39;s Wilder in her story, ending with the dream to be a character in a book, just like Laura was. The book is composed of three sections, each progressing through her elementary school years. The book is the true story of Kathy Rustebakke, with her best friends Kristi and later Patrice, as her family transitions from the horse and buggy days into modern life." />
