  <title>McCain: The Myth of a Maverick - Matt Welch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;John McCain is one of the most familiar, sympathetic, and overexposed figures in American politics, yet his concrete governing philosophy and actual track record have been left curiously unexamined, mostly because of the massive distractions in his official biography, but also because of his ingenious strategy of talking ad infinitum to each and every access-craving media person who happens by. The more he has spouted, the less journalists have bothered trying to see through the fog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;McCain&lt;/i&gt; gives the public what it wants but can&#39;t find -- a flesh-and-bones political portrait of a man onto whom people are forever projecting their own ideological fantasies. It is a psychological key for decoding his allegedly &#39;maverick&#39; actions. &lt;i&gt;McCain&lt;/i&gt; will quickly lay out in overlapping detail the root cause of the senator&#39;s worldview: his personal transformation from underachieving punk to war hawk uber-patriot, in which he used the &quot;higher power&quot; of American nationalism to save his life and soul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;McCain&lt;/i&gt; looks behind the war hero, behind the maverick reformer. Journalist and pundit Matt Welch brings to this project an investigative eye and a coolly analytical mindset to provide Republicans, Democrats and Independents a picture of the man.&lt;/p&gt;" />
