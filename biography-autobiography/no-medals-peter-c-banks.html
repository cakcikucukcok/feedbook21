  <title>No Medals - Peter C. Banks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;No Medals&lt;/i&gt; is a Christmas story wrapped around a search of government records to locate the file of a deceased, black World War II veteran, author Peter C. Bankss father, John Henry Banks Jr. The investigation to find the records begins in 2000 and concludes on Christmas Eve, one year later. Peter Banks recounts the steps that he took to find his fathers service recordssteps that anyone can follow if they would like to locate the war history of a relative who was a veteran of World War II.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The journey is sprinkled with bitter disappointments and exciting revelations as Banks tries to confirm his fathers service as an acting corporal in World War IIa common duty that became a life-threatening activity during his service tour in Europe. At the time of the elder Bankss military service, most of the war experiences of black veterans, no matter how heroic, were not treated with the same respect as those of white soldiers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;No Medals&lt;/i&gt; paints a vivid picture of the segregation of the United States Army of the 1940s. For Banks, it completes his journey to respect his fathers dying words, Do something good; leave a positive legacy in your life  try to do something that will last! &lt;/p&gt;" />
