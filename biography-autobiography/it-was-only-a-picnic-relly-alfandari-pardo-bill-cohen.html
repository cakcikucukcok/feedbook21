  <title>It Was Only a Picnic - Relly Alfandari Pardo, Bill Cohen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
&quot;In 1941, after the German (Nazi) occupation of Yugoslavia, the Jewish population was persecuted and, very soon, deportation began.
&lt;p&gt;
&quot;Following the deportation of her husband and son, and when she realized that women were also being deported, Relly&#39;s mother entrusted Relly to her sister, Relly&#39;s aunt, who was married to a Christian.  A few days later, Relly&#39;s mother was also deported.  Thinking that the end of the war was imminent, the aunt had undertaken to look after Relly.
&lt;p&gt;
&quot;As the war dragged on, and afraid that Relly would be discovered living in their home, endangering the lives of the whole family, the aunt sent her twelve-year-old niece to a village some distance from Belgrade.  There she found refuge with a poor young woman who was chronically ill and who did not know Relly&#39;s true identity.  She accepted to look after Relly for a modest payment.  Relly was all the time in fear that her true identity would be discovered.
&lt;p&gt;
&quot;After some time, she was brought back to Belgrade and hidden in the home of a couple who depended on Relly&#39;s uncle for their livelihood.  There, in a room the size of the mattress she slept on, Relly had to pass her days without giving any sign of life.  In the three-bedroom apartment, two of the rooms were used by a lawyer, who did not know that Relly was there.
&lt;p&gt;
&quot;We learn about the daily tensions - the surreal happenings - lived through by a young girl, in a world which quaked under relentless ferocity while awaiting for the victory of a free world over the barbarians.
&lt;p&gt;
&quot;All through the book, one hears the voice of a young girl and feels with her her on-going, traumatic experiences.&quot;
