Through the joys and perils of his early childhood in Hungary to his last days here, free, in America, he tells us the importance of safeguarding our freedoms by being diligent and aware. This is the story of a true patriot who knows what its like to lose freedom, but also how wonderful it is to get it back. Defecting here after the Melbourne Olympics, Istvan writes about the struggles our great nation has gone through and is going through, and how the possibility that the United States was going to make the same mistakes his homeland, Hungary, did worried him. All through the eyes of one who has seen the horrors of communism and also seen the endless opportunities of freedom, listen as Istvan clearly and unbiasedly explains many difficult problems of today. His ideas and views have come from his many extraordinary experiences and his very deep intellectual thinking.
