  <title>A Dime&#39;s Worth of Paper Plates: One Young Man&#39;s Journey from the Great Depression Through World War II - L.D. (Duke) Hobbs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In A Dime&#39;s Worth of Paper Plates, the author calls himself &quot;a typical guy who became a teenager during the Depression years and became a man during World War II.&quot; Duke begins with his ancestors&#39; history in Norway and their emigration to Iowa in 1892. His grandfather acquired a number of farms in the Norwegian community in central Iowa, and the author lived on one of these farms as a child. His childhood is idyllic, though the Depression and the Dust Bowl years take their toll on the adults in the community. His stepfather takes a job in Pecos, Texas in 1936 and the family adjusts to a new life in this little &quot;cow town.&quot;   Following a year of college, Duke joins the army in 1944 and after training at Ft. Hood is sent overseas for two years. He serves in Company &quot;F,&quot; 314th Infantry, 79th Division in the European Theater. After the war, he returns to Texas A&amp;M to complete his degree. Commissioned as a second lieutenant in the air Force, he serves four years as an intelligence officer during the Korean War." />
