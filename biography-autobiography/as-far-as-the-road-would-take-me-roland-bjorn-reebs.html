  <title>As Far as the Road Would Take Me - Roland Bjorn Reebs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is the true and deeply personal story of Roland Reebs, aka Bjorn, who leaves post-war Germany to discover himself and the world. His unique journey begins in summer 1969 when the 17-year old hitchhikes across Europe and Asia with few resources and no particular destination in mind. His quest for adventure and need for change lead him to India during the hippie movement, to the sleep-ins of Amsterdam, and later to the Canadian north with only a guitar on his back. Whether living on the sunny beaches of Goa or in the cold wilderness of the Yukon, Reebs pushes boundaries and challenges social norms. His adventures are captivating, and his reflections profound. This book is a must-read for those interested in an era when all seemed possible and for those looking towards a better world.&lt;/p&gt;" />
