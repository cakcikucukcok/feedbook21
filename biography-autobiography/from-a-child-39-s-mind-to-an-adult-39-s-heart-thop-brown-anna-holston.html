  <title>From a Child&#39;s Mind; to an Adult&#39;s Heart - Thop Brown, Anna Holston</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 200%; tab-stops: 0in .5in 1.0in 1.5in 2.0in 2.5in 3.0in 3.5in 4.0in 4.5in 5.0in 5.5in&quot;&gt;From a Child&#39;s mind to an Adult&#39;s Heart is written about my life as I saw it as a child and the adults that made an impact on my life. I would like to dedicate this book to all the adults in our community who molded me into the adult I am today. I&#39;m a living witness that one must be careful in the way we act or the things that we say around a child because children tend to mimic adults. We must be careful of the conversations we have when we think children arent listening. Those conversations can come back to either honor or embarrass us when the child becomes an adult. This book is a prime example of how God allows situations and circumstances to be embedded in some childrens minds and hearts for future references. As I look at this world today, and how some children have to worry about where their next meal is coming from or whether their mothers are coming home, I realize how blessed I was to be born in the era of the 50s where the majority of the adults genuinely cared about the well being of the children. This era inspired me to write this book in the hope that it would jog the memory of others, causing them to recall how special they felt when adults took the time out of they busy schedules to play ball or any game with them. Also, some may have forgotten what it was like to be a child without worries. I hope that this book brings back memories of how safe and secure some children felt knowing that a set of adult eyes were always watching out for their safety. Today, children deserve to feel the same type of safety and security that we felt as children. This is their God given right. Let us give our children the happiness and security that they deserve.&lt;SPAN style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

In the same spirit, I deemed it necessary to inform my readers so that they would not be deceived. On one hand, I know that my readers will find laughter and shed many tears.
