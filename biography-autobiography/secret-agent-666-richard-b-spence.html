  <title>Secret Agent 666 - Richard B. Spence</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aleister Crowley is best known today as a founding father of modern occultism. His wide, hypnotic eyes peer at us from the cover of The Beatles&amp;rsquo; &lt;i&gt;Sgt. Pepper&amp;rsquo;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&lt;/i&gt;, and his influence can be found everywhere in popular culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crowley, also known as the Great Beast, has been the subject of several biographies, some painting him as a misunderstood genius, others as a manipulative charlatan. None of them have looked seriously at his career as an agent of British Intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using documents gleaned from British, American, French, and Italian archives, &lt;i&gt;Secret Agent 666&lt;/i&gt; sensationally reveals that Crowley played a major role in the sinking of the Lusitania, a plot to overthrow the government of Spain, the thwarting of Irish and Indian nationalist conspiracies, and the 1941 flight of Rudolf Hess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Richard B. Spence argues that Crowley&amp;mdash;in his own unconventional way&amp;mdash;was a patriotic Englishman who endured years of public vilification in part to mask his role as a secret agent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The verification of the Great Beast&amp;rsquo;s participation in the twentieth century&amp;rsquo;s most astounding government plots will likely blow the minds of history buff s and occult aficionados alike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author &lt;b&gt;Richard B. Spence&lt;/b&gt; can be seen on various documentaries on the History Channel and is a consultant for Washington, DC&amp;rsquo;s International Spy Museum. He is also the author of &lt;i&gt;Trust No One: The Secret World of Sidney Reilly&lt;/i&gt; (Feral House).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
