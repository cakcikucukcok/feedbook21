  <title>Making Out - David Laurence</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Making Out is a novel about a man (David Carter) who writes
a novel about his life as seen through the eyes of his protagonist,
David Nickelson. During his journey (from seventh grade through
his forty-year class reunion) Nickelson, along with many of the other
Carter characters, will not only win your heart, but they will make
you wish that you had lived during those years accurately described
as the Fabulous Fifties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making Out will bring back memories to those who lived
during that era, but it will also allow its younger readers to see, feel,
and experience how life was when their grandparents were young,
discovering, as they will, that those ancient ones were a whole lot
more wild than any of them could imagine. But the 1950s were
only the root years. David Nickelsons life did go on. Experience
with Nickelson and his friendstheir drinking habits, their gangwars
and their brutal personal altercations; discover their religious
beliefs, their early attitude toward, and participation in, the drug
scene; learn of their wild sexual antics along with the tenderness
they could, at the same time, show to those they loved. Learn about
their love of hot cars, their attitude toward those in authority,
their dealings with whores, and their perspective on minority issues.
Last, travel with Nickelson to Viet Nam. Learn what he learned,
and how he dealt with what he discovered. And upon his return,
learn how he, and his friends, made out in a world changing so fast it
made them long for those days when life was easy, when the future
for them seemed so fi lled with good things to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read Making Out and you will learn history, not as it has
been portrayed by the media, but as it actually happened. Read
Making Out and you will know that America can still return to
its roots, its core values, and by doing so become, once again, the
Country it once was.&lt;/p&gt;" />
