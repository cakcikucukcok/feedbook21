  <title>I Want to Destroy Myself: A Memoir - Malika Amar Shaikh, Pinto Jerry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Malika Amar Shaikh was born to Communist-activist parents&amp;mdash;her father, Shahir Amar Shaikh, was a trade-union leader and legendary Marathi folk singer. Brought up amidst the hurly-burly of Maharashtrian politics of the 1960s, and exposed to the best and the brightest in Bombay&amp;rsquo;s cultural scene, Malika was a cosseted child, drawn to poetry and dance. She was barely out of school when she married Namdeo Dhasal, co-founder of the radical Dalit Panthers, and celebrated &amp;lsquo;poet of the underground&amp;rsquo; who transformed Marathi poetry with his incendiary verse.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;After the initial days of love, and the birth of their son, the marriage crumbled. Namdeo was an absent husband and father&amp;mdash;given to drink, womanizing and violence&amp;mdash;and uninterested in his family. And while he would repent his actions and his negligence, and they would make up, he never stopped or reformed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;I Want to Destroy Myself&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;is Malika&amp;rsquo;s searing, angry account of her life with Dhasal.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The unvarnished story of a marriage and of a woman and a writer seeking her space in a man&amp;rsquo;s world, Malika Amar Shaikh&amp;rsquo;s autobiography is also a portrait of the Bombay of poets, activists, prostitutes and fighters. There isn&amp;rsquo;t another memoir in Indian writing as honest and pitiless as this. Published originally in Marathi, it quickly became a sensation and vanished as quickly. Jerry Pinto&amp;rsquo;s superb translation revives this lost classic and makes it available for the first time in any language other than Marathi.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
