  <title>And There You Have Another Hoosier Moment - Larry Vandeventer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is the result of wandering the highways and byways of Indiana and exploring the history and mystery of the state. It is a collection of stories about Hoosiers that may be amusing, surprising, filled with intrigue, educational, and revelations of little-known facts about people. It is about Hoosier lives cut from many bolts of fabric that have been pieced into the quilt called the state of Indiana.&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;You will read how a chance encounter on a train caused one man to write one of the most popular and memorable books of all time along with the fascinating story about an African-American slave lady in Vincennes who sued and won her freedom when Indiana became a state. You will read and learn about a family of neer-do-wells who introduced the world to the art of robbing trains; a runner named Danny who never lost a race; how the stars announced the birth of a great leader; a Reuben who is not a sandwich but pushed his weight around; a doctor whose great interests lay in inventing things; a woman from New Palestine who is the CEO of a major company; two of the greatest coaches ever; a boy named Wonga who became a giant in the entertainment world and how another boy selling newspapers became a huge Hollywood star.&lt;/p&gt;" />
