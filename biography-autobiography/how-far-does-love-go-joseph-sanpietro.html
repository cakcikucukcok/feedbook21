  <title>How Far Does Love Go - Joseph Sanpietro</title>
      <meta name="description" content="You have heard that when someone wants to break up, they say the grass is greener on the other sidemeaning, it must be better. But, I say the grass might be greener on the other side. Maybe even in your mind, it will be better. But grass is only grass. Some are greener. Some has the color of even yellow in it. And some looks like it is even blue. But just remember this, to all of you out there who think it will be better, no matter what the color of the grass, it is still grass and will always taste like grass. As I looked back on my last marriage, I tried to do all I could to get it to work. But when you know you did all the right things for your mate and your children and all they can think of are themselves, well, you know they are not going to do the right thing. You know it is time just to let them go and do the best you can to move on. If you hold on to something bad as I tried to do, it will hurt you and the ones you love.
My children hate their mom now and I can&#39;t stand thinking of all the wrong she did to all of us. But I will not let her turn us into a mold that will cover us in hate. My children are happy with me and for now thats all they need.
No matter what I have gone through in my marriages, a lot has been taken from me, but one thing they could not take is the joy I have kept in my heart for Jesus." />
