  <title>No Room For Watermelons - Ron Fellowes, Lynne Fellowes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In 2012, while others his age were enjoying quiet retirement, Ron Fellowes set off on the challenge of a lifetime. His dream to ride a 102 year-old FN motorcycle across the world - to the Belgian factory where the bike originated - had all the hallmarks of an epic adventure: one that was never going to be easy.&lt;br /&gt;For eight months Ron rode 14,600 kilometres through 15 countries under grueling conditions, into some of the world&#39;s most hostile territory. He faced desert sandstorms, mountains too steep for the motorcycle&#39;s capability, the threat of rockslides and bombings when he took a detour, and pressure from armed police through conflict zones. He was robbed, and when held at gunpoint, Ron came face-to-face with his own mortality.&lt;br /&gt;The motorcycle&#39;s limited capacity - no gears, inadequate brakes and pedal assisted - made it a daily struggle. Breakdowns were common, and only Ron&#39;s ingenuity and single-mindedness, Lynne&#39;s logistical support, and the generosity of others kept him going.&lt;br /&gt;Beautifully illustrated in full colour throughout, &lt;i&gt;No Room for Watermelons &lt;/i&gt;is co-written by Ron and Lynne. It is an engaging, and entertaining account of one man&#39;s stoic determination to fulfill his dream. You will be carried along for the ride, and inspired to achieve your own dreams... no matter how impossible they seem." />
