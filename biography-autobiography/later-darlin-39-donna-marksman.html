  <title>Later Darlin&#39; - Donna Marksman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Early in 2008, my husband died, after forty very eventful years together. Devastated by his loss, I finished writing the biography he had started, depicting those years, and titled it See You Later, Darlin, which was his catchphrase.
A tribute to him and the other West Indian immigrants who came to Britain in the 1950s, the book is full of passion and soul. It tells of the courage shown by a generation to whom so much is owed. Shocking in parts, but yet it is uplifting too.
Following the books publication, I received e-mails, letters, and comments from readers who had been in similar situations. Encouraged by their correspondence, I wrote this sequel, Later, Darlin, based on how I and others dealt with issues such as financial affairs, getting back into a social life, dating, and even whether it is cool to have a sex life over sixty. Full of humor and respect, it shows how people can heal and move forward. I hope others will be empowered by this book to do the same in similar circumstances." />
