  <title>Love in a Bottle - Marge Pickering</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Embarking on a brand new adventure, I moved with my sixteen year old daughter from Kentucky to California at age 54, with the dog in the back seat. I was swept into a new exciting life, totally different from anything I had known before. After a fun relationship with a young man who turned out to be
gay, I found my soul mate and was ready to ride off into the sunset with him. We decided to marry on Valentines Day of the next year. However I discovered he was alcoholic and that in fact, I had been dating and marrying alcoholics most of my life. Tragically, his drinking got so intense that I put a stop to the wedding and convinced him to go into recovery. With my heart breaking, I drove him to that recovery center
on the very day we were to be wed, February 14th. Instead of pledging my eternal love to him, there I was dropping him off to sober up. After his stay there, we started our new adventure, but he vacillated between sobriety and drinking again. Through our mutual progress, we learned to come together and live life in a different way. We each had a separate path but retained the connection we originally found. We both found serenity and peace and a wonderful life together." />
