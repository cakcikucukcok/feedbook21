  <title>Traveling Music - Neil Peart, Mike Knowles</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Neil Peart decided to drive his BMW Z-8 automobile from L.A. to Big Bend National Park, in Southwest Texas. As he sped along &quot;between the gas-gulping SUVs and asthmatic Japanese compacts clumping in the left lane, and the roaring, straining semis in the right,&quot; he acted as his own DJ, lining up the CDs chronologically and according to his possible moods.
&quot;Not only did the music I listened to accompany my journey, but it also took me on sidetrips, through memory and fractals of associations, threads reaching back through my whole life in ways I had forgotten, or had never suspected.? Sifting through those decades and those memories, I realized that I wasn&#39;t interested in recounting the facts of my life in purely autobiographical terms, but rather ? in trying to unweave the fabric of my life and times. As one who was never much interested in looking back, because always too busy moving forward, I found that once I opened those doors to the past, I became fascinated with the times and their effect on me. The songs and the stories I had taken for granted suddenly had a resonance that had clearly echoed down the corridors of my entire life, and I felt a thrill of recognition, and the sense of a kind of adventure. A travel story, but not so much about places, but about music and memories.&quot;" />
