  <title>I Think I Grew up Better Than You - Michael Colyer, Emily Findlow</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
    Northern Rhodesia just off the Congo border in the nineteen fifties was thick with untamed bush, man height grass, and tall vined trees. The sweltering
    heat, animal paths, deadly reptiles, stinging insects, and its rivers and streams, was the world of the author and his young friends. The deluging rains,
    the floods and the forked lightning heralding thunderstorms, were all part and parcel of growing up in the best playground in world.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Author Michael Colyer encapsulates the wonderful enthusiasms of developing young boys. He exalts the driving force behind their escapades and antics in and
    just outside of a small copper mining town. In his words, our games were inadvertently dangerous learning curves, and we literally tried everything young
    boys dared to imagine.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    The dangers shout out to you, the adventures, the boys, the animals, the reptiles and insects are very real, and the happenings are a recitation of true
    and unforgettable memories.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    The astounding historical, geographical, animal and reptilian facts are seamlessly woven to the tales, but, read it alone, or risk laughing out loud in
    company at the wicked humour the author has managed to incorporate throughout.
