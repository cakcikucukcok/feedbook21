  <title>When Jesus Knocks, the Angels Play - Mary Jo O&#39;Brien</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;When Jesus Knocks, the Angels Play&lt;/i&gt;, author Mary Jo OBrien tells of being healed of life-threatening illnesses and surviving a serious accident, thanks to Gods intervention through His angels. But despite these blessings, OBrien was stubborn and certain she knew better than God. But, once she acknowledged that God held all the cards, the floodgates of His mercy opened wide.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;When Jesus Knocks, the Angels Play&lt;/i&gt;, lets you see the angels sense of humor and the ways Jesus answers the authors questions and confirms her missions. But perhaps most important, you will see the role the Holy Spirit plays in delivering spiritual strength and directives to help others in their most difficult times. OBrien also describes the experiences she has with the Holy Spirit as she hears the soothing and consoling voice drawing her into the presence of Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning to listen for the voices of God and His angels can be challenging, especially if you are in the middle of a difficult situation. As you read, you will see how the Holy Spirit will bring you closer to those relationships and open your spirit to receive the blessings and miracles that God has for you.&lt;/p&gt;" />
