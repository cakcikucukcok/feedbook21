  <title>A Game of Sailors - Ken Evans</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The title, A Game of Sailors was taken from a favourite phrase used on the Flight Deck, whilst in action in 1956, perhaps more as a rebellious than amusing statement; but to me it summed up the jaunty spirit of the men who flew the planes and those who kept them flying. But this story is also about growing up, and how even the smallest and strangest experiences can leave their mark, and even shape a tiny bit of history! Suez was the last real engagement by a Royal Navy Fleet, and Concorde project was the realization of an Aviators dream; and all the other bits and pieces of Service life during the 1950s and 60s, added together, seems now to have been the most exciting time to be living. Certainly the times were a-changing, they changed us, and they changed the world." />
