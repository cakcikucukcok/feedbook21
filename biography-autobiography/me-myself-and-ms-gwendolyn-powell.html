  <title>Me, Myself, and Ms - Gwendolyn Powell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Me, Myself and MS is a true-to-life, heartwarming, and inspirational memoir that deals with what I went through and go through on a day-to-day, more specifically, a minute-to-minute basis in the battle of living with multiple sclerosis. This book will give a detailed description of my life from the moment of diagnoses to the many symptoms, medications, treatments, and some of the possible side effects. It is also a portrayal of the tears, laughter, triumphs, and tribulations that are a part of living with multiple sclerosis. Me, Myself and MS is not only targeted for people living with multiple sclerosis, but it is also for anyone dealing with lifes challenges and who are in need of a little inspiration. It makes a statement that the choice is yours. You can submit to your illness and hardships, or you can see these challenges as a new chapter in your life and move forward fighting tooth and nail with each new blow that is thrown you way. With two hundred people diagnosed weekly with multiple sclerosis, this inspirational book will help ease some of the fears about what you might go through. It is meant to encourage and guide those that are going through this journey or any challenges in their lives. In my family, there are four of us living with multiple sclerosis, and I was the first to be diagnosed. There was no one that I could turn to for advice as to what to expect. I hadnt even heard the words multiple sclerosis or what this illness was, so I wanted to pass along that although you have been given a new life/way of living, you can/will survive your diagnoses. This is a journeyone that I have been on for twenty-three years and counting." />
