  <title>Your Mind Is God&#39;s Point in You - Hemf Kognov</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Hi! I am the Author of my Book&lt;br&gt;
Do You Want To Help Yourself?
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The USA Health problem.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Im taking in one tablet. Thanks to God,&lt;br&gt;
I am almost normally healthy.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
People can be healthy or healthier.&lt;br&gt;
Their thinking maters for their health.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Every person may be happy or happier.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Our own problems we are able to solve.&lt;br&gt;
Gods Points are in everyone.&lt;br&gt;
You can prove it to yourself.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Pages about that are in my Book. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Do You have a question?&lt;br&gt;
Do You need to solve a problem?&lt;br&gt;
Is something bothering You?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Ask YOURSELF the Safest Question:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
What Is Best For Me To Do Now?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In 2-3 minutes a Thought would arrive &lt;br&gt;
In your Head.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
To ask the Safest Question, STOP.&lt;br&gt;
Plug your ears. Close your eyes.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
More about that is written in the Book&lt;br&gt;
Do You Want To Help Yourself?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Who likes to know if Dear Gods Points&lt;br&gt;
Exist in You? You can prove that God&lt;br&gt;
Is with You.  How?&lt;br&gt;
You can buy that book&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
PLEASE HELP YOURSELF&lt;br&gt;
TO BE HAPPY&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Human beings do long for happiness.&lt;br&gt;
You can help yourself to feel happy.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Whole daylong you were doing&lt;br&gt;
something to better the life on Earth.&lt;br&gt;
Now do something good for yourself:&lt;br&gt;
List up all your Todays activity.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Your Mind is involved in all your&lt;br&gt;
doings. Please thank your Mind.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
For me it works that way.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
1. During the day or at evening-time&lt;br&gt;
I list everything I did today.&lt;br&gt;
If something needs to be&lt;br&gt;
finished, I make a note.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
2.I went over the listing again. &lt;br&gt;
Now I am thinking about every&lt;br&gt;
item on my list. I know what &lt;br&gt;
each thing means for me. &lt;br&gt;
I know how I accomplished it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Morning time.&lt;br&gt;
1. Checks book!&lt;br&gt;
2. Garbage.&lt;br&gt;
3. Henry.&lt;br&gt;
4. Breakfast.&lt;br&gt;
5. Post office.&lt;br&gt;
6. Gas station!&lt;br&gt;
(7) Going to work.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Evening time.&lt;br&gt;
1. Mail.&lt;br&gt;
(2) A letter.&lt;br&gt;
3. Shopping.&lt;br&gt;
4. The stove!&lt;br&gt;
(5) Healing.&lt;br&gt;
6. Trifles.&lt;br&gt;
7. TV news.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
At the list Checks book monthly &lt;br&gt;
bills are paid. One deposit was made.&lt;br&gt;
A few pages at the checkbook were &lt;br&gt;
balanced. I love my Mind for that.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
My trifles include: To make the bed.&lt;br&gt;
To dress up, undress. Hair. The toilet.&lt;br&gt;
To drink my everyday water. To wash&lt;br&gt;
my hands, so on. Usually I soap my&lt;br&gt;
hands 3-4 times at one wash hand.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Very important items, I circle,&lt;br&gt;
or I put a mark!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Im writing the listing for&lt;br&gt;
myself every Today.&lt;br&gt;
Listing helps me to be happy.&lt;br&gt;
It is a joy-therapy for me.&lt;br&gt;
It would bring joy to you.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
We are, what  we are.&lt;br&gt;
You may help yourself.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Please be glad to be You.&lt;br&gt;
Your feelings would be up.&lt;br&gt;
Tell yourself: I did all that!&lt;br&gt;" />
