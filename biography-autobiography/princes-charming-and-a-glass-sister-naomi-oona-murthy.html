  <title>Princes Charming and a Glass Sister - Naomi Oona Murthy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cousin to schizophrenia, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Borderline Personality Disorder &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(BPD&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;) &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;affects about 2% of the population&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our father&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; ricocheted through childhood as one of 3 siblings dropped at a Sasakatchewan, Canada orphanage in the mid-1920s. As a child,-Edgar went to farm foster homes, was adopted once, and sent back. Their father surfaced briefly, from Michigan, dying of TB which he gave me - in 1952 or 53 and the siblings estranged each other, totally, by the early 1970s.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edgar borderlined or schizophreniaed his way&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; through a crude and lewd control freak adulthood --menacing his wife and 3 children - moving us so frequently, well - from age 5-12 I attended 13 schools and moved 18 times. He was a self-made (?) Ameri-Canadian gipsy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abused by my grade 1 teacher, I lost my age 6 year to amnesia, once she was caught. I woke up, age 7, at a different school, new town. Despite other child and adult traumas, that was my &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; dis-associative experience. My childhood was normal enough, after that, school-wise, til grade 7.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Childhood stopped at age 12. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chased out of home at noon, Dad brutally discarded me to Childrens Services the same afternoon. They moved and got a silent phone number. Four years of messing with my teenage-hood followed as he took me back and made me run away in fear all the time. Bait and switch by Dad and anxiety/depression ruled those years. I &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; knew where I stood with him.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;At age 15, 20 days shy of 16, Pierre, 21, Dad forced us into a doomed marriage. By age 20, I was divorced and re-married.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A lot of life happened between ages 20-38. Then, happily married, &lt;/em&gt;22 years ago, I survived a weird sexual assault, in a &lt;em&gt;work colleague, off-duty environment: by a police detective &lt;/em&gt; my temporary boss for a week. Curiously, other police witnessed but did not intervene. &lt;em&gt;His, their, alcohol abuse was involved.&lt;/em&gt; It was really stupid. No one is identified, herein, by name - only by rank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I translate my 16 dream journal and some of their &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;universal symbols and themes. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;I was &lt;/em&gt;Carl Jung and Sigmund Freud, et al, studied/influenced and &lt;em&gt;psycho-analyst-assisted&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no children and am glad to not pass on damaged chromosomes.&lt;/p&gt;
