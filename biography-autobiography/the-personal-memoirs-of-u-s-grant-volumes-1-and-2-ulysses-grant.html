  <title>The Personal Memoirs of U. S. Grant, Volumes 1 and 2 - Ulysses Grant</title>
      <meta name="description" content="From his boyhood in Ohio to his graduation from West Point, and then into detailed accounts of his service in the Mexican-American War, the Civil War, and his presidency, Grant gives a full report of his life and career in this excellent autobiography. Written in the last year of his life as he battled throat cancer and poverty, &quot;Personal Memoirs&quot; was published by Mark Twain shortly after Grant&#39;s death, less than a week after he completed his work. An instant success and praised by admirers, critics, and people throughout the country, this autobiography was a critical and financial success. Grant was praised both for the clarity and succinctness of his writing, and the royalties of the book provided for his family and firmly re-established their financial stability. A model of autobiography to this day, &quot;Personal Memoirs&quot; is a remarkable work of literature, reflecting the man and ideal commander largely responsible for the welfare of his country throughout his life." />
