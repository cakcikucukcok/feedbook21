      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;Now I See the Moon&lt;/em&gt; provides insightful ways to teach and work with individuals with autism and severe disabilities.

In the process, she founded The Miracle Project, a groundbreaking organization that uses the performing arts to connect with children with autism. Both controversial and unorthodox, Hall&amp;#8217;s innovative approach has been praised by leaders in the field of autism. She was also the subject of an Emmy-Award-winning documentary &lt;em&gt;Autism: The Musical&lt;/em&gt;. Hall now speaks around the country sharing her wisdom. &lt;em&gt;Now I See the Moon&lt;/em&gt; is a story of hope, faith, and miracles; it is a story only a mother could tell.&lt;/p&gt;" />
