  <title>Shadows of My Past - Marcey Oliver</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt; This story is about my life from a child growing up on an island in the Caribbean to who I am today.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt; It describes my love for one man who did not have the foresight to reveal his love for me and who left me to go overseas without any commitments, and who did not have any communication with me for months. It further outlines how I dealt with my heartache, and after feeling defeated, how I turned to another man who pursued me and provided the security and peace I needed and whom I married.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt; This is a story of my life with my husband of thirty years. The children we had and our travels and the great life and love we shared. This is the story of my devastation when my husband died and my decision to return to University to fill the gap, so I could go on with my life, as I wanted no one else.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt; True love returned when my telephone rang in my home, and at the other end of the line was my first love who I had not seen or heard from for thirty eight years, how we renewed our acquaintances and realized just how much we were still in love with each other. The pain and anguish was again experienced due to his indecisions, unavailability and inability to make a firm commitment about our new relationship,&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt; In this book are our conversations and letters I have written to him but never gave him, our quarrels, our sorrows and our visits, and above all, my frustration at his lack of commitment.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;" />
