  <title>A Trilogy of Hope - Celia Perryman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Following on from a childhood where I was loved at home, but didnt fit in at school and never really felt like I belonged anywhere, I became depressed and suicidal at age 12 and spent much of my teenage years medicated and in therapy, questioning the point of my existence and wondering whether the world would be better off without me. 
I wrote my first book, Ive Got Something to Say: Alone and Screaming in the Darkness at the age of 16 because, although I didnt exactly have any answers, I wanted to reach out to others so they wouldnt feel so alone. I decided there and then, that if I ever did find any answers then I would write more books. And that is what I have done. I wrote my second book, Maybe We Are All Relevant: At Times I Can See the Light at the age of 20, and the third and final part of this trilogy, And Now I Know Why: A Life of Sunshine, Storms and Rainbows at the age of 32. 
I have decided to publish my three books together as A Trilogy of Hope: My Journey Out of the Depths of Teenage Despair, so that I can share my whole journey with you and to give you and others hope in seeing that it really is possible to go from the absolute depths of despair to leading a life in which there is love, light and joy, where I have found some meaning to my existence and all the pain I have been through seems worth it because it has led me to where I am today.
I feel honoured to be sharing my story with you and I hope that my words can be of some comfort to you and bring you hope for a happier future. Things will get better. You are going to be okay. I am thinking of you.
With love,
Celia." />
