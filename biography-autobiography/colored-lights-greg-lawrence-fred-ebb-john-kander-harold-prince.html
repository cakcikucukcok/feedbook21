  <title>Colored Lights - Greg Lawrence, Fred Ebb, John Kander, Harold Prince...</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The autobiography, in dialogue, of the composer and lyricist of &lt;i&gt;Chicago&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Cabaret &lt;/i&gt;as well as a wise and witty memoir of forty years of American musicals.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Composer John Kander and lyricist Fred Ebb are the longest-running composer-lyricist team in Broadway history, having first joined forces in 1962. The creators of such groundbreaking musicals as &lt;i&gt;Chicago&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Cabaret&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Kiss of the Spider Woman&lt;/i&gt;, Kander and Ebb have helped to push American musical theater in a more daring direction, both musically and dramatically. Their impact on individual performers has been great as well, starting with the handpicked star of their first musical: an untested nineteen-year-old named Liza Minnelli (who writes of this experience in her introduction).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colored Lights covers the major shows of Kander and Ebb&#39;s partnership, from &lt;i&gt;Flora, The Red Menace &lt;/i&gt;(starring a then-unknown Liza) to &lt;i&gt;The Visit&lt;/i&gt;, due to open on Broadway in 2004. The pages and musicals in between reveal what has made theirs such a long-lived musical partnership--and one so valued by the artists they have worked with. In recounting the genesis and controversies of &lt;i&gt;Cabaret&lt;/i&gt;, reflecting on the superstar mentality of such artist as Frank Sinatra and Barbra Streisand, and recalling their work with Bob Fosse on &lt;i&gt;Chicago &lt;/i&gt;(as well as their views on the blockbuster 2002 film), John Kander and Fred Ebb provide a history not only of their own lives but also of the American musical theater of the late twentieth century.&lt;/p&gt;" />
