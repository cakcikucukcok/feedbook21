  <title>Forestry Flavours of the Month - Alastair Fraser</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Forestry touches on all aspects of human welfare in one way or another, which is why foresters need to play an active role in determining our collective agenda.
Alastair Fraser, a lifelong forester and the co-founder of LTS International, a forestry consulting company, explains how forestry changes with political cycles and how foresters can promote healthy forests at all times. He explores critical issues such as:
  forests and their connection to coal;
  forests role in combatting floods and climate change;
  illegal logging in Indonesia, Laos, and elsewhere;
  tactics to promote sustainable forestry management;
  plantations as a solution to tropical deforestation.
From pulping in Sweden and Brazil, paper mills in Greece and India, agroforestry in the Philippines, pink disease in India and oil bearing trees of Vietnam, no topic is off limits.
Based on the authors life as a forester in dozens of countries, this account shows the breadth of forestry and makes a convincing case that forestry management needs to focus on managing change and achieving sustainability.
Whether youre preparing to become a forester, already in the field, or involved with conservation, the environment or government, youll be driven to action with Forestry Flavours of the Month." />
