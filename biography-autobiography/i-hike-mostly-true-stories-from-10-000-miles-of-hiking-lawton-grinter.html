  <title>I Hike: Mostly True Stories from 10,000 Miles of Hiking - Lawton Grinter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;I never set out to hike 10,000 miles. It just sort of happened over the course of a decade.&quot; And so goes Lawton Grinter&#39;s compelling collection of short stories that have been over ten years and 10,000 trail miles in the making. I Hike brings the reader trailside with blissful moments on the highest mountain ridges to the mental lows of mosquito hell and into some peculiar situations that even seasoned hikers may find unbelievable. Between jobs and in search of something more, Lawton Grinter spent the better part of a decade hiking America&#39;s longest trails.  In doing so he came face to face with things that go bump in the night, the kindness of strangers, a close encounter with hypothermia and the absurd rights of passage common to the eccentric people that call themselves long-distance hikers. Anyone who&#39;s ever stepped off the pavement will appreciate these humorous and sometimes agonizing accounts of trail life. I Hike will make you laugh, cry, cringe and leave you wanting to read more!" />
