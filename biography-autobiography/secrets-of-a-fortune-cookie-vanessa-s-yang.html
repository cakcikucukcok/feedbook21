As a strictly raised Chinese Singaporean expatriate student in international schools, she was also influenced by her friends and peersand their Western ideals. Her mothers relentless Eastern upbringing, dominated by an isolated focus on academics alone, was not a productive fit to a teenagers growing desires to fit in and find encouragement and love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These disparate experiences and lifestyles were the seeds of her vicious teen rebellion against everything her parents honored, and it was these acts of defiance that ultimately climaxed her insecurities.
