  <title>The Breast is History: An Intimate Memoir of Breast Cancer - Bronwyn Hope</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In 2011 writer and mother of two, Bronwyn Hope is diagnosed with early stage breast cancer.  &lt;br&gt;Encouraged by a friend, she begins an online blog in which she faithfully diarises the days that follow, graphically chronicling the details of even her darkest days as they happen. Her reflections are controlled yet raw and immediate, comprising a mix of honesty and humor that will have you by turns laughing out loud, or crying.  &lt;br&gt;Over an 18-month period, Bronwyn propels her readers on a journey that will deliver to her some of life&#39;s greatest blows and most uplifting moments. Along the way she shares intimate accounts of her life, her family and friends, and the challenges, both common and uncommon, of a breast cancer survivor.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Breast is History&lt;/i&gt; is that rare book that will delight and move readers at the same time as demystifying the experience of millions of women with breast cancer.    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;About the Author&lt;/u&gt;:&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;br&gt;Born in Sri Lanka to parents of mixed Sinhalese, Scottish and Belgian heritage, Bronwyn Hope lives in the sunny state of Queensland, Australia with her husband, Alan, her two children, Harrison and Benjamin, and her labradoodle, Spunky.  &lt;br&gt;Bronwyn is a public relations consultant who currently runs a small consultancy from home, sometimes being paid handsomely by generous clients for her work. What this really means is that, in the main, she sits around in her pyjamas for a big part of the morning, playing online Scrabble, Facebooking and drinking coffee.  &lt;br&gt;Sometimes, this also means she has time to write, the result being one work of fiction, &lt;i&gt;4:05-A Novel&lt;/i&gt;, a small collectible book titled &lt;i&gt;A Little Gift of Wisdom&lt;/i&gt;, a Presentation Training workbook, and a compendium of poetry that is soon to be released.  &lt;br&gt;In her spare time, Bronwyn indulges a suite of interests which, at time of writing, includes soccer refereeing, rowing, swimming, walking her dog, trivia, drawing and painting, music, public speaking, cryptic crosswords, entertaining and learning Spanish. Bronwyn is currently working on a second book to assist women in their transition from breast cancer to good health." />
