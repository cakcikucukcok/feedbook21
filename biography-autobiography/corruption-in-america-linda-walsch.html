  <title>Corruption in America - Linda Walsch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The reason for the title of this book is how things have happened and the way it happened in my life time.  How your professionals are corrupt. The people that are supposed to protect you, help you, in health and function in life are corrupt. These professionals are suppose to be leaders and explaes, cannot do their job right. The professionals need to clean up their own house first. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Corruption is so bad, its dishonest, destroying your integrity.  No sense of value. To me they don&#39;t seem to be honest or willing to make things right. Your professionals have so much education and so much schooling; they seem to over look the perception and reason of the job." />
