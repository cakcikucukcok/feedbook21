  <title>The Girl I Left Behind - Judith Nies</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;At the height of the Vietnam War protests, twenty-eight-year-old Judith Nies and her husband lived a seemingly idyllic life. Both were building their respective careers in Washington&amp;#8212;Nies as the speechwriter and chief staffer to a core group of antiwar congressmen, her husband as a Treasury department economist. But when her husband brought home a list of questions from an FBI file with Judith&#39;s name on the front, Nies soon realized that her life was about to take a radical turn. Shocked to find herself the focus of an FBI investigation into her political activities, Nies began to reevaluate her role as grateful employee and dutiful wife. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A heartfelt memoir and a piercing social commentary, &lt;em&gt;The Girl I Left Behind&lt;/em&gt; offers a fresh, candid look at the 1960s. Recounting Nies&#39;s courageous journey toward independence and equality, it evaluates the consequences of the feminist movement on the same women who made it happen&amp;#8212;and on the daughters born in their wake. &lt;/p&gt;" />
