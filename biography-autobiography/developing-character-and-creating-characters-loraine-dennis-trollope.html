  <title>Developing Character and Creating Characters - Loraine Dennis Trollope</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This story has been written to identify who these people were in their life in badlands and on the plains of Eastern Montana by providing a cameo of their daily life.   It proposes a study of the factors that led to the development of character and at the same time developing characters.  The method of this analysis uses simple stories of incidents common to those who endured the hardships and challenges of that sometimes-austere environment.  Who are these people and how did they get to be the way they are.
This book was written for the purpose of encouraging others to write their own stories that can be shared with their family and the generations to follow as they travel along lifes way.   Sadly, history not documented is history lost.  Every person is important.  Every person has value.  Every person has a story to tell.  Let the pages of this book provide a springboard to the documentation of countless stories of precious lives not only on the prairie but also in the city and elsewhere.
It is hoped that by the sharing of these Eastern Montana personal stories that they may spur interest in Eastern Montana towns and villages to encourage development of tourism, industry, and its history, talents and art.
Perhaps this book will be instrumental in helping others who feel downtrodden to take a second look at their life, enter the battle and approach their obstacles with a tenacious can do attitude.
Of course, some will read the book just for the sometimes-foolish stories of the portrayal of farm-ranch life and let it go at that.  But to the serious reader, it is hoped they will analyze well beyond what is written because that is what eventually creates your character also. Realizing that it is OK to become a character while developing your own character." />
