  <title>Thoughts of a Crazy Old Man - Mikel W. Dawson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When youre on the downhill side of life, what things do you think about? This is one of the questions crossing the mind of Mikel W. Dawson. The author has experienced many facets of life, and now wants to raise questions and give a little advice on how to approach the turns in lifes road.
Thoughts of a Crazy Old Man also answers a lot of question that readers have asked since his previous book Guides Life.
This book doesnt just cover one subject, but many things common to us all. Life, weather, work, women, politics, religion, and kids are just a few of the topics Mikel expounds on and gives some advice, telling what hes learned over the years and the things hes done.
Thoughts of a Crazy Old Man isnt meant to provide all the answers, but rather give insight on how one man has dealt with the things common folk experience every day.
If you want to find out how a guy growing up in Southwest Idaho in the late 50s and who graduated high school in the 70s figured out his own answers, grab a drink, pull up a comfortable chair, and put on your reading glasses. Get ready for Thoughts of a Crazy Old Man." />
