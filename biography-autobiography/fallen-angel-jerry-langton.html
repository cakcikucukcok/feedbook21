  <title>Fallen Angel - Jerry Langton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Walter Stadnick is not an imposing man. At five-foot-four, his face and arms scarred by fire in a motorcycle accident, he would not spring to mind as a leader of Canada&#39;s most notorious biker gang, the Hells Angels. yet through sheer guts and determination, intelligence and luck, this Hamilton-born youth who had the nickname of &quot;Nurget&quot; rose in the Hells Angels ranks to become national president. Not only did he lead the Angels through the violent war with their rivals the rock machine in Montreal in the Nineties, Stadnick saw opportunity to grow the Hells Angels into a national criminal gang. he was a visionary--and a highly successful one.  Bikers are not known for their fondness for rival gangs. Stadnick and the Angels fought and defeated rival gangs, or used power of persuasion to patch them over. As Stadnick&#39;s influence spread, law enforcement took notice of the growing presence of the Angels in Ontario, Manitoba and British Columbia. However, Stadnick&#39;s success did not come without a price. Arrested and charged with 13 counts of first-degree murder, stadnick beat the murder charges but was convicted of gangsterism and is currently serving time. &lt;em&gt;Fallen Angel&lt;/em&gt; details one man&#39;s improbable rise to power in one of the world&#39;s most violent organizations, while shedding light on how this enigmatic and dangerous biker gang operated and why it remains so powerful.&lt;/p&gt;" />
