  <title>Overcoming Loss and Embracing Hope - Kathy Trant</title>
      <meta name="description" content="On the morning of September 11, 2001, I was a happy woman, living a life I loved. I had a husband I adored and three amazing children. Life was good. In one horrifying instant, it seemed, my world was shattered when the twin towers fell. My loving husband was gone, and the life I had known went with him. It took me years to crawl out from the wreckage of that event, and though I cant say Im healed, I consider myself a survivor.
The events of 9/11 changed our entire country as profoundly as it changed my young family. We all promised to never forget, and that is what I am trying to do by sharing my story. I want the world to never forget my husband Danny, as well as the events that took him away from us. He meant the world to me, and I want his legacy to live on the way he still lives in our hearts.
