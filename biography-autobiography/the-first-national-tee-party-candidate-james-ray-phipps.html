  <title>The First National Tee-Party Candidate - James Ray Phipps</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What I will share with you in this book is HOW you can earn more money in the profession of direct sales and social networking than most people working in high paying management positions for large corporations earn today.
You have the option of believing what I will share with you or throwing this book into the trash can once you read it. However, until you can personally earn from a half million dollars to two million dollars per year, doing your thing, your way you will be wise to learn as much as possible about network marketing, social networking to tell others about what you do for a living and about what you have to share with the consumer public.
I THANK GOD daily that I was shown the social networking concept for achieving success that I learned about during the early years of my adult lifetime. If I had waited on those in government to do what they are supposed to do to preserve personal and financial independence for the poor and middle class working people, I would have never achieved the American Dream of living an abundant lifestyle. The information within this book CAN set you financially free." />
