  <title>A Collar Well Worn - Rev. Paul F. McDonald</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;A Collar Well Worn&quot; is the work of an ninety year old Catholic priest who spent more than thirty years each in civilian ministry and another thirty years as an Air Force chaplain. Rev. Paul F. McDonald has knitted together sixty years of events from the 20th century, by describing stories about those periods, the geography and history of places where he lived and served, some of the notable people he had known during fifteen assignments and a few dozen temporary duty assignments in Western Europe, the Pacific region, and the United States. He served the Catholic Church and his Country, during and after the dynamic times of the Second Vatican Council, 1962-65, during this time he listened to his people in a collaborative ministry in bringing about the necessary pastoral and liturgical changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such reforms, and others, continue to shape a revitalized church, and a resilient people who feel empowered as the &#39;people of God&#39; to work with all people of good will. Surely, such an abundance of experiences provide a panorama of a life&#39;s journey in the service of God, Church, and Country, during which time he was proud to wear &quot;A Collar Well Worn.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
