  <title>I Like You Just the Way I Am - Jenny Mollen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; Best Seller!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;By the actress, writer, and one of the funniest women on Twitter, an outrageous, hysterical memoir of acting on impulse, plotting elaborate hoaxes, and refusing to acknowledge boundaries in any form&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jenny Mollen is an actress and writer living in Los Angeles. She is also a wife, married to a famous guy (which is annoying only because he gets free shit and she doesn&#39;t). She doesn&#39;t want much from life. Just to be loved--by everybody: her parents, her dogs, her ex-boyfriends, her ex-boyfriends&#39; dogs, her husband, her husband&#39;s ex-girlfriends, her husband&#39;s ex-girlfriend&#39;s new boyfriends, etc. Some people might call that impulse crazy, but isn&#39;t &quot;crazy&quot; really just a word boring people use to describe fun people? (And Jenny is really, really fun, you guys!) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In these pages, you&#39;ll find stories of Jenny at her most genuine, whether it&#39;s stalking her therapist (because he knows everything about her so shouldn&#39;t she get to know everything about him?); throwing a bachelorette party so bad that one of the guests is suspected dead; or answering the eternal question, &lt;i&gt;Would your best friend blow your husband on a car ride to dinner if she didn&#39;t know you were hiding in the backseat?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;I Like You Just the Way I Am&lt;/i&gt; is about &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; doing the right thing--about indulging your inner crazy-person. It is Jenny when she&#39;s not trying to impress anyone or come across as a responsible, level-headed member of society. With any luck it will make &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; better acquainted with who &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; really are and what &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; really want. Which, let&#39;s be honest, is most likely someone else&#39;s email password.&lt;/p&gt;" />
