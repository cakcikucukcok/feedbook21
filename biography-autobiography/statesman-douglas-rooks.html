  <title>Statesman - Douglas Rooks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Over the course of his long and storied career, George Mitchell proved to be much more than just that senator from Maine. He is one of the last from a sort of &amp;quot;golden age&amp;quot; of American politics, when opposing parties worked together to accomplish things for the good of the nation, rather than the good of the party. Before becoming senator, Mitchell was an attorney and then a judge in Maine. Among his many public efforts, he is perhaps known for his environmental work and his work on peace and justice, especially his brokering of the peace in Ireland and his efforts in the Middle East.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, seasoned journalist Douglas Rooks gives us a thoughtful and highly readable look at the man and his public work. While the book traces his personal life, it is primarily a political biography, exploring his time in office as well as his public work before and after his elected terms.Compiled from extensive interviews with Mitchell as well as staffers and others who&amp;#39;ve known and worked with him, it is as much an exploration of American politics at a time when politics could actually be said to have &amp;quot;worked,&amp;quot; as it is a man whose vision and ideals have helped shape the world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
