  <title>Heaven Knows, Anything Goes - Dianne DeMarinis de la Vega PhD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In 1979, Beverly Hills psychotherapist, Dr. Dianne de la Vega, meets movie star and vocalist, Dick Haymes. Dianne is enchanted with his remarkable baritone voice. After an intense fourteen-day courtship, she moves into his apartment.
For Dianne, the first three months of their relationship is sheer bliss, a series of Hollywood banquets, parties, and hilarious housekeeping. Dianne learns the meaning of celebrity. Only references to ex-wife Rita Hayworth mar her excitement and break the spell. 
The two lovers are confident, in spite of Richard&#39;s health and financial problems, ex wives, and drinking. A second chance has been granted to them. 
Dianne flies to Detroit for the closing night of the Big Broadcast of 1944 with Harry James, starring Dick Haymes. Sitting on the edge of her seat in the audience, Dianne realizes Haymes has been drinking to find the strength to go on stage. The last song he ever sings is for her-:&quot;The More I See You.&quot;
Haymes tells the press from his hosipital bed when asked if he is ready to go, &quot;I&#39;ve had it all, known everybody, had everything except love. Now I have that, too.&quot; He glances at Dianne who is devastated.
The morning after his death, she finds a single red rose wrapped in baby&#39;s breath on her doorstep with a card-&quot;In Memory of Love.&quot; She knows it&#39;s from Haymes, who guides Dianne to Hawaii, Alaska, and Findhorn, Scotland. She learns life does exist after death and unconditional love lasts forever." />
