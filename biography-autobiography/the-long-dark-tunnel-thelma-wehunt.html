  <title>The Long, Dark Tunnel - Thelma Wehunt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;/p&gt;It had been six months since their beautiful Christmas in California, and Thelma Wehunt was expecting another wonderful time shortly. Her daughters and grandchildren were on their way to visit her in Oklahoma. Wanting everything to be perfect upon their arrival, Thelma called again to check on their progress and make sure there were no final arrangements that needed to be made to welcome them home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The voice on the other side of the line, however, was not one that she recognized. At that point, her life was thrown into a chaotic turmoil that could only be calmed by time, support, and the deep, soothing conviction of her unwavering faith in her loving God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tragedy visits us all, but there may be nothing more deeply tragic than a mother outliving her children. In her memoir, Wehunt shares the touching testimony of her journey through the long, dark tunnel of despair to emotional recovery after losing both children and grandchildren to a terrible and unforeseeable accident.&lt;/p&gt;" />
