  <title>Life After the Wife - Dave Pinder</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A true, open, and honest version of events in my life after the wife. Its sexy, funny, informative, and emotional.
Starting with a few pages of how I got to be who I am, not too in depth but enough to make your imagination work.
Followed by how I got into escorting and what I got up to as an escort, moving on to my time on the Internet dating sites, how I got on with some women I met and how with some I didnt. I get on my soapbox every so often talking about benefits, money, and maintenance! I try my best to explain how to make your sex life better without trying to sound like I know it all because I certainly do not. I originally wrote this with men in mind that were separated or divorced, but the sexual advice is great for any couple especially married ones. LOL. People of all age ranges from over eighteen obviously have liked the samples of the book they have read and have given me great reviews. I hope you also enjoy it." />
