  <title>It&#39;s a Part of Life - Onawa K. Pleasures</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;Its a Part of Life&lt;/i&gt; tells the true story of three siblings coming of age during the 1960s and 1970s. 
Junie, Marie, and Allen face heartache, triumph, and tragedy during an era of shifting values and social revolution. Through their stories, readers will experience the highs and lows of growing up during these turbulent times.
Each sibling faces unique challenges: Junie, the oldest, is a high school basketball star whose world is shattered by a horrible knee injury. Told by the doctor that he will walk with a limp for the rest of his life, he battles through the pain and disappointment in order to rehabilitate his injury and serve his country. Marie, his younger sister, marries a tall, handsome marine when she is nineteen but soon finds herself trapped in a rocky, combative relationship. She must gather the strength to leave her husband and raise her child all on her own. Allen, the youngest, is whisked away to Vietnam right after high school graduation. He must learn to become a man even though he is barely out of his teenage years.
&lt;i&gt;Its a Part of Life&lt;/i&gt; stands as a testament to the transformative power of perseverance and a constant reminder of the importance of compassion." />
