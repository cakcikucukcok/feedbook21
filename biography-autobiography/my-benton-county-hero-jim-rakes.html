It is an excellent running history of our miserable time in Korea. I think it is accurate. There were lots of events that I either didn&#39;t remember or never knew about. And I am sure that would be true of every man in A Battery from Bentonville, Arkansas,who will read the book. We all have our own experiences, and no one knows every thing that happened to any one else over there, but you have sure as hell captured a lot of my memories and experience. I know that it took a lot of research andjust plain dam hard work to set it to paper. I don&#39;t have the patience for that. You have told your story and you have done a good job of it. It must be very therapeutic for you.Not many people attempt it, or want to. Or even have a story.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;DIV&gt;You are Jim Rakes and you did as you pleased. The only way any one ever has freedom is to self impose strict discipline on themselves. Thanks for the work. All of A Battery who read it will be grateful to you, as I am. &lt;/DIV&gt;
&lt;DIV&gt;Thank you for the hard work you did for me while we were over in Korea. Never for a minute did I have to be concerned about you running your section in a professional military manner. You were a good soldier. I know Master Sergeant material when I see it. You were young,eager,smart, and had a go for it attitude. That is why you were picked for the job of Master Sergeant. I really wasn&#39;t looking out for you as much as I was for my self and the Outfit. You justified my judgment. I have always known that I made a good decision when I chose you for the jobs that I needed you to perform. You served our country, the Outfit, and me in an outstanding manner. From an old Master Sergeant who knew. BDH &lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;" />
