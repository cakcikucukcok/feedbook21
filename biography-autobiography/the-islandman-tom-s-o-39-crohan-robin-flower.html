  <title>The Islandman - Tom치s O&#39;Crohan, Robin Flower</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Tomas OCrohan was born on the Great Blasket Island in 1865 and died there in 1937, a great master of his native Irish.  He shared to the full the perilous life of a primitive community, yet possessed a shrewd and humorous detachment that enabled him to observe and describe the world.  His book is a valuable description of a new vanished way of life; his sole purpose in writing it was in his own words, to set down the character of the people about me so that somerecord of us might live after us, for the like of us will never be again. The Blasket Islands are three miles off Irelands Dingle Peninsula.  Until their evacuation just after the Second World War, the lives of the 150 or so Blasket Islanders had remained unchanged for centuries.  A rich oral tradition of story-telling, poetry, and folktales kept alive the legends and history of the islands, and has made their literature famous throughout the world.  The 7 Blasket Island books published by OUP contain memoirs and reminiscences from within this literary tradition,evoking a way of life which has now vanished." />
