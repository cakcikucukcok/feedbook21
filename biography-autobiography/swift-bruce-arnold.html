  <title>Swift - Bruce Arnold</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Who was Jonathan Swift? Bruce Arnold&#39;s provocative book examines this enigmatic figure in the light of his relationships - with his lover Esther Vanhomrigh (&#39;Vanessa&#39;), his ward Esther Johnston (&#39;Stella&#39;), and his many great male friends: Congreve, Temple, Bolingbroke, Harley, Pope, Addison, Thomas Sheridan, and others. Though often caricatured as a bitter misanthrope, Swift can only be properly understood if we recognize his love of humanity and his capacity for friendship. Arnold traces this theme from Swift&#39;s youth in Ireland and his literary and political apprenticeship at Moor Park in Surrey, and on through the years of greatness - the brilliant satires and pamphlets, the Church diplomacy at the Court of Queen Anne, and the great writings of his maturity: the Drapier&#39;s Letters, A Modest Proposal, and Gulliver&#39;s Travels. Here, for the first time, Swift&#39;s long and varied life is illustrated through contemporary engravings of the places he lived in, the people he knew, and the leading figures who defined his age." />
