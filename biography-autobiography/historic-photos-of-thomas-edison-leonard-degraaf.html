  <title>Historic Photos of Thomas Edison - Leonard DeGraaf</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;With 1,093 U.S. patents to his credit, Thomas Edison was one of history&#39;s most prolific and influential inventors. His Menlo Park and West Orange, New Jersey, laboratories pioneered industrial research and produced the first phonograph, practical incandescent electric lamp, and motion picture camera. Edison was also an entrepreneur who created dozens of companies to market his inventions, and he played important roles in the creation of the electric power, sound recording, and motion picture industries. Edison was also one of the first modern celebrities. The 200 photographs in this book, selected from the Edison National Historic Site archives, portray Edison&#39;s long career, from his earliest experiences as a railroad newspaper vendor and telegrapher in the 1860s to his last important research project in the late 1920s, a search for domestic sources of natural rubber. These photographs provide revealing glimpses as well of his family life and personal friendships.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
