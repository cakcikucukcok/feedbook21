  <title>Musing and Munching - Gloria VanDemmeltraadt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Gloria Jane Tyler Shigley Cannon VanDemmeltraadt is a self-described Gray-haired grandma, whos survived a number of life-style extremes and still manages to ride the bumps and smile through it all. 
She describes memories like sifting flour. The original product is one thing, but when it is sifted or strained through a screen it falls below in a new form. Memories are sifted through the minds of everyone who shares the same event, and the resulting product is changed forever. 
Musing and Munching is a unique collection of memories and menus that VanDemmeltraadt has put together to share stories of her life. She overlaps these stories with a wide variety of foods and recipes that have followed her diverse life path.
As the stories unfold, readers will both laugh and cry and mouths will water. This charming volume will find its way to many a kitchen shelf where precious cookbooks are saved.
VanDemmeltraadt lives and cooks in Minnesota with her husband, Onno.

&lt;b&gt;Book Reviews&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Musing and Munching&quot; by Gloria VanDemmeltraadt is riveting!  I had a hard time putting it down.  The connection between the smiling Gloria who I know with the Gloria in the book was amazing.  Her inner strength and courage shine through the pages.  Sharing her recipes throughout her story gives greater meaning to them, and helped me to understand their importance in her life.  Wonderful book!" />
