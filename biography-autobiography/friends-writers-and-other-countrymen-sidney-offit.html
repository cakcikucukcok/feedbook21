  <title>Friends, Writers, and Other Countrymen - Sidney Offit</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;Sidney Offit has devised a marvelous mirror of his unique personality as well as a one of a kind tour of the New York literary world in the last half century. Anyone even faintly interested in books will find it impossible to put down.&quot;---Thomas Fleming, bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Liberty! The American Revolution&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sidney Offit&#39;s charming memoir of a writer&#39;s life ingeniously reflects some of the greatest (and most infamous) literary, political, and sports personalities of our century. His early days in Baltimore (where he met H. L. Mencken and entertained Robert Frost) are as engaging as his later encounters with Dylan Thomas, John Steinbeck, Pablo Neruda, Heinrich Böll, and some of the era&#39;s greatest ballplayers: Robinson, Mantle, Mays, and Williams. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mixing with a remarkable and diverse crowd, led Sidney to run-ins and adventures with Truman Capote (&quot;What kind of guy are you?&quot;), Jackie Kennedy (in a corner), Kurt Vonnegut (who identified Sidney as his &quot;best friend&quot;), the incomparable Toni Morrison, and other bards, muses, and just plain folk. Their conversations are recalled with gentle humor and a keen eye for a New York where casual and spontaneous encounters may shape what the country reads or where a stroll around the corner can change a life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
