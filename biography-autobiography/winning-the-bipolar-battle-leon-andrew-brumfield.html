  <title>Winning the Bipolar Battle - Leon Andrew Brumfield</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book tells of a twenty-year battle with bipolar disorder and how Leon Brumfield has overcome the challenges. God&#39;s mercy and grace have blessed Leon to not just cope with the disease but to excel against all odds. Although Leon had to be hospitalized in maximum-security hospitals on numerous occasions, he has flourished spiritually, mentally, and emotionally. Some of Leon&#39;s victories in this timespan include obtaining his MBA, having a successful marriage, being the proud father of a beautiful ten-year-old girl, and preaching the gospel for over twenty years. Leons motto is, If you want something you never had, you must do something you have never done. Leon stresses that all things are possible to those who believe. He demonstrates to bipolar families that bipolar can be conquered by the power of Jesus Christ. Bipolar does not have to be a persons end. Bipolar has been a stepping stone for Leon, and he encourages people that the bipolar mountain can be climbed through persistence, dedication, and an open heart." />
