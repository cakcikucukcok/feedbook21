  <title>The School Bus Doesn&#39;t Stop Here Anymore: Reflections from a Foothills Farm - Noreen Olson, Will Ferguson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Welcome to &lt;B&gt;Noreen Olson&lt;/B&gt;&#39;s kitchen table, where everything happens. She loves birds, animals, family, children, friends, growing things and life on the farm, and writes about them and all the odd situations they manage to get into with engaging liveliness. Many of the pieces are humorous, but more than that, they are heartwarming and true. In them you will see reflections of your own loves, life, guilt, laughter, nostalgia, memories and beliefs.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;All of the animals, people and incidents are real (though Noreen admits that she is prone to the occasional slight exaggeration) and names have been changed for &quot;her own protection&quot;. The titles of the short tales say it all: Saving the Preemie Calf, My Career As an Egg Grader, Lament for a Lousy Garden, Kitchen Archaeology, Embarrassing the Kids, The Lawn Ornament Vendetta and One More Way to Ruin a Party.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;Noreen Olson&lt;/B&gt; has been writing these true tales in her biweekly column for more than twenty-three years, and collected them in six books. These stories are the best of the best, together with newly written introductions to thematic groupings, and an introduction by Will Ferguson.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
