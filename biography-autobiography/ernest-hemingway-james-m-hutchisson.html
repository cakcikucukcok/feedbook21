  <title>Ernest Hemingway - James  M. Hutchisson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;To many, the life of Ernest Hemingway has taken on mythic proportions. From his romantic entanglements to his legendary bravado, the elements of Papa&amp;rsquo;s persona have fascinated readers, turning Hemingway into such an outsized figure that it is almost impossible to imagine him as a real person. James Hutchisson&amp;rsquo;s biography reclaims Hemingway from the sensationalism, revealing the life of a man who was often bookish and introverted, an outdoor enthusiast who revered the natural world, and a generous spirit with an enviable work ethic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an examination of the writer through a new lens&amp;mdash;one that more accurately captures Hemingway&amp;rsquo;s virtues as well as his flaws. Hutchisson situates Hemingway&amp;rsquo;s life and art in the defining contexts of the women he loved and lost, the places he held dear, and the specter of mental illness that haunted his family. This balanced portrait examines for the first time in full detail the legendary writer&amp;rsquo;s complex medical history and his struggle against clinical depression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first major biography of Hemingway in over twenty years, this monumental achievement provides readers with a fresh, comprehensive look at one of the most acclaimed authors of the twentieth century.&lt;/p&gt;" />
