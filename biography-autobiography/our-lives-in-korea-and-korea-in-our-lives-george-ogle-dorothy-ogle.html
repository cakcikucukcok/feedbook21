  <title>Our Lives in Korea and Korea in Our Lives - George Ogle, Dorothy Ogle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Because he prayed in public for eight men who were tortured, forced
to make false confessions and were sentenced to death by South
Koreas military dictatorship, in 1974 George Ogle was deported from
the country where he had worked as a missionary for 20 years. Two
months later when Dorothy and the four Ogle children left Korea,
friends and colleagues commissioned them to Go tell our story.
After the South Korean people ended the military dictatorship in
1987, the story changed from the struggle for democracy and human
rights to a story of the Korean movement for peace and reunifi cation
of their divided nation.
Compelling and comprehensive, Our Lives
in Korea and Korea in Our Lives is not only
the Ogles personal memoirs of living in
South Korea from 1954-1974 and later
visiting both the North and South, it is an
effort to tell the story of the Korean people
as the authors experienced it directly, and as
it has come to them by closely following the
evolving history through almost 60 years.
The book highlights the hope and promise of President Kim DaeJungs
Sunshine Policy of constructive engagement with North Korea and
is written to give readers around the world a vision for ending the
Korean War to bring peace, prosperity and reconciliation to all of the
Korean people." />
