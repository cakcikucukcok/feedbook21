  <title>Christian Exploitation - Macharia Gakuru</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Archbishop Gilbert Deya is based in the United Kingdom. He is fighting extradition to Kenya where he faces charges of alleged child trafficking. In the UK he runs his Christian Ministry, Gilbert Deya Ministries and a television station. Deya comes from the Luo tribe of Bondo, in Nyanza, western Kenya. He claims to be a cousin to the current Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga and the USA President Barack Obamas father. Both men come from the same tribe as the Archbishop. This dare preacher condemns Microsoft founder Bill Gates funding and supporting vaccination program in Africa as killing people and thus reducing world population. Mr Deya is a man accused of allegedly trafficking children into the UK. Apparently, by praying for barren women, in the UK, they fell pregnant and then they would travel to Kenya to give birth to normal healthy babies, in less than the usual nine months. They would then bring their new born babies to the UK.
His spiritual powers have enabled him to exploit the poor and the vulnerable. He took advantage of their fear of the power of witchcraft and the power of generational curses, which was highly emphasized in his Christian teaching. His brand of theology is a unique combination of traditional African religions and beliefs, peppered with threats of curses but tampered with exorcisms and stirred with Christian love. It is babies arose. Mr. Deya has this unique charisma which he is fully aware of and uses to keep a hold on his flock. He identifies and exploits their weaknesses and vulnerabilities creating an illusion, a mirage of the existence of the miracle babies. The amazing story is unraveled in the pages of this book.
In propagating this illusion Mr. Deya again unleashed his weapons of intimidation and threats, both physical and alleged powers of miracles, signs, and wonders and his ability to corrupt." />
