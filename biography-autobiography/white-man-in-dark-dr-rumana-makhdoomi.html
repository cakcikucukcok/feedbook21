  <title>White Man in Dark - Dr. Rumana Makhdoomi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When turmoil broke in Kashmir in 1989 so much happened there- an explosive uprising,   rule of gun on the streets, exodus   of Kashmiri Pandits and conversion of Kashmir into a beautiful prison. Whiteman in dark is a memoir of a female doctor trained in Kashmir during the peak years of turmoil. The pain of spine-breaking crackdowns, unending curfews, violent protests and prolonged sieges is described in the setting of Downtown Srinagar adjoining the area of Kohimaran where Muslims, Hindus, and Sikhs would converge and bow together.  Besides an in-depth account of the effect of turmoil on the lives of medical students, medical education and healthcare the memoir describes how doctors were churned out in adverse circumstances. After militancy was curbed, the lull and calmness seen as signs of peace returning-was a temporary fatigue, with people flooding the streets again in 2008,2009  and 2010.This time the weapon was a stone and not a gun. Same story happened,...Curfew returned, disorder prevailed and Kashmiri again was the target. Today became another yesterday.
The memoir is meant to touch the heartstrings of all sensitive beings who believe in peace. It is first memoir by a Kashmiri female and first one by a doctor." />
