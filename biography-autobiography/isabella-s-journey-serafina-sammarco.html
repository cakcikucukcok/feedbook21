  <title>Isabella’S Journey - Serafina Sammarco</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Isabella Marie Sammarco (Oct. 7th, 1971  July 29th, 1986)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isabella was known by her family and friends for her tremendous zest and respect for life; with a sparkle in her eyes and a contagious smile, she taught those around her to appreciate their lives and to love one another. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although she was very much aware from an early age that her life would be short, this knowledge did not stop her from living with a purpose and making each day count.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isabella was diagnosed at eight months with Thalassemia Major  a genetic blood disorder  that required her to have regular, monthly transfusions to survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She fought vigorously to overcome the numerous obstacles that she encountered during her brief life, until her small body could fight no more. Isabella died two months short of her fifteenth birthday. This book is the heartfelt, truthful account of a brave soul and her dedicated family. It is a story that will touch all who read it and inspire those looking for guidance and hope.&lt;/p&gt;" />
