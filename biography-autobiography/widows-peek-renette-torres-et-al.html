  <title>Widows Peek - Renette Torres et al</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Widows Peek shows you a magnified view of the unsettling life changes after the death of a husband through the eyes of nine courageous women who share their stories of love, loss and starting over. Being a widow has never been an everyday topic of conversation, but it should be. You will meet these widows who came together to share their personal experiences through intimate accounts, revealing powerful truths and profound discoveries that are inspiring enough to help any woman get through that horrible void.&lt;br /&gt;
Although there is loneliness, we are not alone. We have learned that widowhood is a huge, life-altering, but growing experience. We also learned that there is no book written by a group of women for women that details the pain, sorrow, coping, and eventual recovery from the loss of a spouse. The need for such a book is apparent, a book that explores the lives of women transformed by widowhood, in which we share our own unique way of dealing with the death of our loved one. These pages are written with real emotion, warmth, and even with unexpected humor.&lt;br /&gt;
Not just anybody can be a widow; it can only and exclusively be  a woman!&lt;br /&gt;
