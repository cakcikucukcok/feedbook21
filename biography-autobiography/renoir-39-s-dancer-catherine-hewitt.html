  <title>Renoir&#39;s Dancer - Catherine Hewitt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Catherine Hewitt&#39;s richly told biography of Suzanne Valadon, the illegitimate daughter of a provincial linen maid who became famous as a model for the Impressionists and later as a painter in her own right.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 1880s, Suzanne Valadon was considered the Impressionists&#39; most beautiful model. But behind her captivating façade lay a closely-guarded secret. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Suzanne was born into poverty in rural France, before her mother fled the provinces, taking her to Montmartre. There, as a teenager Suzanne began posing for--and having affairs with--some of the age&#39;s most renowned painters. Then Renoir caught her indulging in a passion she had been trying to conceal: the model was herself a talented artist. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some found her vibrant still lifes and frank portraits as shocking as her bohemian lifestyle. At eighteen, she gave birth to an illegitimate child, future painter Maurice Utrillo. But her friends Toulouse-Lautrec and Degas could see her skill. Rebellious and opinionated, she refused to be confined by tradition or gender, and in 1894, her work was accepted to the Salon de la Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts, an extraordinary achievement for a working-class woman with no formal art training. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;Renoir&#39;s Dancer&lt;/i&gt; tells the remarkable tale of an ambitious, headstrong woman fighting to find a professional voice in a male-dominated world.&lt;/p&gt;" />
