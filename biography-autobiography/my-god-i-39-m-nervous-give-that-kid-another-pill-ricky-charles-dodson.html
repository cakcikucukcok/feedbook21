  <title>My God I&#39;m Nervous, Give That Kid Another Pill! - Ricky Charles Dodson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I sat at my computer to read a few chapters of this book and did not get up until I had finished it.  What an insightful adventure!  He certainly comes by his storytelling talents naturally.  I thoroughly enjoyed the &quot;highs&quot; and even the lows, if I&#39;m to be honest.  I recommend this book to everyone, but especially to anyone who thinks they cannot overcome (much less THRIVE), broken parts of their past. Thank you Rick for sharing.    Mona Mellon
Rick makes you feel like you are sitting around a campfire telling tales.  He has a knack of pulling you into his story and making you want more.  I laughed and cried, sometimes in the same paragraph!!  Thank you for sharing your book Rick.  I truly enjoyed it and look forward to reading more in the future.    Marsha Whitley
Rick Dodson&#39;s book is at once intimately personal and universally accessible.  A powerful story of the triumph of self over the crushing forces of ignorance and the state. Bravo!   Sean Poole
&quot;I was so honored, and more than a bit curious, when Rick asked me to be his &quot;first reader&quot;.  He said &quot;These stories&#39;ll kinda make you see what made me, me.&quot;  Well, if you know Rick, and what a wonderfully unique and creative person he is, then you&#39;ll understand why I couldn&#39;t wait to dive in!  Some people are handed the world on a silver platter, and still manage to waste their lives.  Others, like Ricky Charles Dodson, get handed a pile of poop -- and use it to create an amazing garden.  Read this book, and find out what made this guy one-of-a-kind!&quot;    Becky Thomas Lane" />
