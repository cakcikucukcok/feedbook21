  <title>A Plane Crash Survivor’S Miraculous True Story - Samuel Aigbe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Samuel Aigbe was one of ten survivors of the Kenya Airways flight KQ431 plane crash over the coast of Abidjan, Ivory Coast, on 30th January 2000, of which there were 169 fatalities. He holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Political Science and Public Administration from the University of Benin, Edo State, Nigeria.
In the aftermath of the plane crash, he gained two postgraduate degrees: Master of Arts in Human Rights, Ethics and International Relations; and Master of Law in International Law with International Relations both from The University of Kent, Canterbury.
Samuel Aigbe vividly brings to light the incidents prior, during and after the crash. He shares his life as a testament of the goodness of God that saw him through that gruesome moment in the harmattan (seasonal freezing hazy wind from the Sahara desert), in the dark Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Africa. He recounts how his faith saw him through that dreadful moment, before being fished out by two white French fishermen into their boat.
