  <title>Saddam: King of Terror - Con Coughlin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insightful, penetrating, and shocking, the defining biography of Iraq&#39;s deposed tyrant&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drawing on an unparalleled network of sources, contacts, and firsthand testimonies, Con Coughlin takes us to the center of Saddam Hussein&#39;s complex, bewildering regime -- and beyond. Fully updated and revised, Saddam: His Rise and Fall meticulously describes how Hussein took power and immediately set about controlling every aspect of Iraqi life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coughlin examines Hussein&#39;s regime both before and after its fall, exploring the contradictions of Saddam&#39;s private life: his sponsoring of Islamic fundamentalism while whiskey drinking and womanizing as well as his reliance on and celebration of family negated by his violent and temperamental treatment of them. With evidence from family members, servants, and staff, &lt;em&gt;Saddam: His Rise and Fall&lt;/em&gt; is unique in its close-up representation of this elusive and secretive world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In all-new chapters and an epilogue, and with shocking new disclosures, Coughlin also vividly recounts the last few months of Saddam&#39;s reign and his eventual capture by American forces.&lt;/p&gt;" />
