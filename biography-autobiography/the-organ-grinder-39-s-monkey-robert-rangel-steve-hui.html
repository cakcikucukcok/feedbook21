  <title>The Organ Grinder&#39;s Monkey - Robert Rangel, Steve Hui</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A riveting saga of deceit, scandal, sex, greed and power&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve traveled all over the world. I&#39;ve stayed in the best hotels and eaten in the best restaurants. But that isn&#39;t me. I&#39;m a simple man. I have simple tastes and I live in a simple house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But people who knew of my past life still want to know . . . what&#39;s it like? What&#39;s it like to work for the richest family on earth, the Royal Family of Brunei?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Well they have money and they spend it,&quot; I answer them. I tire of the subject. I know once they get a taste of the story, the questions will keep coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;No,&quot; they answer. &quot;That&#39;s not what I mean. What&#39;s it like to travel with the Royal Family? What are they like?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can I answer that? &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are they like? They are one of the last true monarchies here on earth. They still rule with a word and with a wave of their hand, no different than they did centuries ago. I worked for a true monarchy, which could have been taken straight out of the movie, &quot;The King and I&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is not enough time in a day or even a week to tell them all there is to tell. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet this story is true. It is no movie nor is it a fairy tale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I lived it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a simple man like me who lives in a simple house, to become a slave of the highest order and to have lived in their world is still surreal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see you interrupting me, &quot;A slave you say. There are no longer any slaves.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I scoff at you. I was indeed a slave. What do you call a person who has no life other than what the prince or princess gives them as their daily morsel. What do you call a man who does not sleep but maybe three hours a night waiting by the phone for orders or instructions for twelve years on end? Shall I tell those who ask that the work almost killed me several times over? Shall I tell them that I was indeed a slave who lost his wife because of years of neglecting her and who did not get to see his own children grow up?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shall I tell them of the deceit, lies, and backstabbing which were the normal part of my everyday existence. Shall I tell them that maybe only one out of ten thousand men could have done my job because of the miracles that they expected me to perform?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No slaves indeed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to my life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
