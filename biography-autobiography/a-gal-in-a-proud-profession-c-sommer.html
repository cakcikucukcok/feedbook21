  <title>A Gal in a Proud Profession - C. Sommer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When I was born in 1925, I think our family was pretty much Father knows best until 1929, when the stock-market crash ushered in the Great Depression. After that, the kindest way I can describe it is dysfunctional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we always had food and shelter, there was little else. Love and kindness were displaced by anger and sarcasm. School became my salvation working on projects and acquiring as, copyediting the high school newspaper, and being on the varsity debate team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our daily newspaper had Aunt Claras Page that paid a dollar for every poem or essay publisheda double thrill, to be published and have a whole dollar, which surprisingly I was allowed to keep. I also had a few articles published as an RN that paid considerably more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I graduated from nursing school in 1947, married in 1948, had children in 1949 and 1952, graduated from college in 1980, and then retired in 1987 at the age of sixty-two so that if I died young, I would be able to enjoy some time of my own. I did have several volunteer jobs. In 1996, I had surgery for scoliosis, which did more harm than good and curtailed much of my activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote this book in 1993 and sent several letters of inquiry, but no one ever read it. In 2011, my son read it and offered to get it published.&lt;/p&gt;" />
