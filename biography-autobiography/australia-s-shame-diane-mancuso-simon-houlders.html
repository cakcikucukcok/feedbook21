  <title>Australia’S Shame - Diane Mancuso, Simon Houlders</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;center&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Australia&#39;s Shame&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Collaboration by Diane Mancuso and Simon Houlders&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;True stories not to be missed&lt;br&gt;Read the horrific true stories of Diane Mancuso and Simon Houlders&lt;br&gt;You will be enthralled, captivated by the raw emotion that jumps off the pages&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hypocrisy of the State that charmed the public into believing that these children who had been removed from their families were going to be better off. Secretly and shamefully the children were treated with contempt, exploited and abused. Diane recounts in &#39;Lynwood Hall&#39; her experiences of her time in care.&lt;br&gt; 
Diane&#39;s father&#39;s treacherous two-faced perfidiousness had no bounds and caused her great pain and regret.&lt;br&gt; 
Simon&#39;s brutal honesty and beliefs challenge and question, even ridicule, society&#39;s philosophies on his views.&lt;br&gt; 
Explore his concepts of the inspirational story of &#39;Three Generations of suffering.&#39;&lt;br&gt;Both authors have unique skills that will take you on a journey that will evoke your own imagination to share in their pastimes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#39;Children begin by loving their parents. After a time they judge them. Rarely, if ever, do they forgive them.&#39;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oscar Wilde&lt;/p&gt;" />
