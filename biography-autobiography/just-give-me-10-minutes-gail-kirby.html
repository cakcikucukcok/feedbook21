  <title>Just Give Me 10 Minutes - Gail Kirby</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Gail has an incredible perspective as the mother of an injured Corpsman who suffers from PTSD. At the Armed Forces Foundation, we believe families serve too and Gails journey is one necessary to tell. When I first met Gail six years ago at Bethesda, I was immediately taken in by her warmth and generosity. Shes a natural and gifted storyteller who deserves far more than 10 minutes. 
Patricia Driscoll, President of the Armed Forces Foundation 
Christmas Day 2006. Dustin Edward Kirby was serving his second tour in Iraq. The dreaded phone call came; Dusty had received small arms enemy fire. This is a first-hand account of how this event changed Dustins life and the lives of his family, and their seven year struggle to understand not only the physical trauma inflicted by his injury, but also the symptoms of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. The physical impact of the injury was critical as the armor piercing bullet travelled through his face. The emotional and psychological impacts have been debilitating. This is the story of a family making every attempt to find a way to give their hero the reasons that he needs to live...every single day." />
