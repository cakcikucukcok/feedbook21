  <title>Sometimes You Have to Lose to Win - David Shaw</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I cannot get in a hurry for my spirit growth. I have to believe that God is working in my life, even when I dont feel like it. Spiritual growth is tedious work, a step at a time. Everything on earth has its own time and its own season. I often get disappointed when God doesnt answer my prayer. But God answers prayers when he gets ready, not when you get ready. One thing I know is that God does not ever let me down. Whenever I think hes not there, he alwaysI mean alwaysworks it out. All I have to do is believe in him and he will take care of me. He never lets me down. Every time I did good work, he would all ways reward me with something good, and when I do something bad, he would take it away so I would not hurt myself. Take it from me. Someday, I will be free." />
