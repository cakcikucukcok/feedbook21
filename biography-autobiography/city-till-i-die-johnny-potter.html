  <title>City Till I Die - Johnny Potter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book follows my journey from 1970-1980, growing up following my beloved Stoke City. During this decade in the history of our football club, we achieved highs and lows of unbelievable proportions. As every Stoke fan knows only too well, our club never does anything in half measures. 
If you wish to share in some of the triumphs and tragedies of Stoke City and its famous, and sometimes infamous supporters, during the 1970s, then this is the book for you. As always, with Stoke City, the journey is a tidal wave of emotions. That though, is part of the deal when following the famous red and white stripes. Those afore-mentioned supporters have often been labelled unique in their influence over the team.Whilst the behaviour of Stoke fans has been questioned many times, I believe their loyalty is without equal in football circles. We Stokies typically wear our hearts on our sleeves, but it is that emotional bond that ties us to the club with such special effect. So for just a short while, leave these heady days of the Premier League, and come back and see what made it so important that we finally got there." />
