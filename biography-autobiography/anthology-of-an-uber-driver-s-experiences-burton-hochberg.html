  <title>Anthology of an Uber Driver’S Experiences - Burton Hochberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="After driving for Uber for a short time, I realized that I had the fodder for another book. Unique stories were happening in my car every day. I did not start out with the thought of eventually writing or even publishing a book. All I did was to build files with anecdotal material. I called the files Uberisms.  
Upon conclusion of the first file, I printed copies of it and distributed it to my riders while continuing to write Uberism: Book2. I repeated the process I started, and upon conclusion of the second chapter, I printed copies of it to distribute to my riders. That became an expensive process. Since these files could be found on Facebook, I just chatted with my riders about Uberisms and told them how to access them on the computer. It was at that point that I gave consideration to publishing a book.
At that point, the number of individual Uberisms reached five files, totaling about seventy-five thousand words, and it was time to publish my works, but I needed an all-encompassing title. That was the birth of Analogy of an Uber Drivers Experiences." />
