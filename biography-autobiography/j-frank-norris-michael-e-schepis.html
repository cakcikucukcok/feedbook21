  <title>J. Frank Norris - Michael E. Schepis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As one of the most fascinating and sensational personalities, J. Frank Norris, has become a forgotten figure of the twentieth century, as many people today have never heard of him. This fascinating true story takes you from his poverty as a child to the pastor of the largest church in America where he later became friend of presidents and giants of industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would love to have known him personally. He (J. Frank Norris) was a great, positive influence and wonderful example for pastors.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt; Dr. Charles Stanley, pastor of First Baptist Church, Atlanta, Georgia, and founder of In Touch Ministries &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J. Frank Norris, without a doubt, in my own thinking, was the greatest preacher of the twentieth century and I knew a good many of the great oneshe stood head and shoulders above all of them.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt; Dr. John Rawlings, The Rawlings Foundation Administrator&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
The life of J. Frank Norris was filled with stories of adventure, courage, faith and dangerthe stuff from which legends are made. He met opposition head on and did not fear any man.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Dr. Homer Ritchie, author and evangelist&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the first half of the Twentieth Century J. Frank Norris was the most dynamic, controversial, and successful pastor of that era. There will never be another like him.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Dr. James O. Combs, Provost, Louisiana Baptist University&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
