  <title>Dance Me Beautiful - Deborah Graham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Author Deborah Graham was thirty-three years old, recently divorced and on the verge of paying someone to teach her to dance. She wanted
every ounce of her being to feel truly beautiful. Graham admits she felt frivolous and foolish, but she took the first step to finding passion in her life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; In &lt;i&gt;Dance Me Beautiful&lt;/i&gt;, Graham narrates a simple and hopeful story of the life lessons she learned through ballroom dancing. This memoir follows her journey from her first dance lesson to tests, competitions and performances as she struggles to break free from her shame and self-doubt. Graham shares her memories of how she
felt, what she learned from her instructor
and how, step-by-step, she
learned to dance herself beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engaging and compelling, &lt;i&gt;Dance Me
Beautiful&lt;/i&gt; serves to inspire others to
take chances and fulfill their dreams
and to help awaken their own inner
creativity and beauty.&lt;/p&gt;" />
