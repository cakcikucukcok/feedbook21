  <title>Behind and Beyond the Badge - Donna Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;There is so much more to a police officer&amp;rsquo;s badge, to any badge that all first responders wear. But that&amp;rsquo;s what the world sees&amp;mdash;a badge. What&amp;rsquo;s behind and beyond that badge is what people need to know&amp;mdash;the person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In BEHIND AND BEYOND THE BADGE, Donna Brown takes you to those places that few see. She shows you that those behind the badge may wear a different uniform than other occupations, but they too have families. They too pay bills, and they love the communities where they live and serve. Each one faces all that life has to offer, good and bad. They have dreams just like you, and they continue to give even after their law enforcement careers ends. The difference between their jobs and most other professions is that a first responder might not come home from work at the end of the day. Each has lost a coworker who died in the line of duty, someone who may have also been a friend, a family member, or even a spouse, because while others run from danger, they run to it. They do this for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So now, open the cover, and meet some of these amazing people!&lt;/p&gt;" />
