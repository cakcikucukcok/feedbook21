  <title>The Confessions of Saint Augustine - Anonymous</title>
      <meta name="description" content="„Confessions” is the name of an autobiographical work, consisting of 13 books, by St. Augustine of Hippo, written between AD 397 and AD 398. Heartfelt, incisive, and timeless, „The Confessions of Saint Augustine” has captivated readers for more than fifteen hundred years. The son of a pagan father and a Christian mother, Saint Augustine spent his early years torn between conflicting faiths and world views. His Confessions, written when he was in his forties, recount how, slowly and painfully, he came to turn away from his youthful ideas and licentious lifestyle, to become instead a staunch advocate of Christianity and one of its most influential thinkers. Philosophically and theologically brilliant, sincere in its feeling, and both grounded in history and strikingly contemporary in its resonance, „The Confessions of Saint Augustine” is a timeless classic that will persist as long as humanity continues to long for meaning in life and peace of soul." />
