  <title>Tales of the Endless Mountains - Adell Farley Harvey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A young professional family from the Midwest follows God&#39;s call to minister in a poverty pocket in northern Appalachia, where their expectations run headlong into the reality of mountain culture. Quirky characters, outhouses, horning parties, cow riding, quilting bees, maple sugarin&#39;they all become part of the fascinating daily life of the Farleys as they work to rebuild a struggling church in a quaint hamlet of Riggs, Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Nothing thrills me more than stories of God working in big ways in small places. This is why &lt;i&gt;Tales of the Endless Mountains&lt;/i&gt; is such a treasure! Every page contains riveting adventure, humor, and wisdom, all proclaiming God&#39;s amazing grace and power. It almost reads like a fictional account. (How could real life in a country church be so dramatic?!) Woven into the tales you will find boat-loads of encouragement, challenges to enlarge your faith, and superb ministry insightsin fact, more (and better!) advice than many books written expressly for that purpose, which qualifies it for a ministry primer. And, I am pleased that it all happened during the Farleys&#39; years of exemplary service with RHMA!  - Dr. Ron Klassen, Executive Director, Rural Home Missionary Association&lt;/p&gt;" />
