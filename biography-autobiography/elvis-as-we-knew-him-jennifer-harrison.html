  <title>Elvis as We Knew Him - Jennifer Harrison</title>
      <meta name="description" content="You are invited to take a journey, along with the author, to her hometown in the American South, a unique culture of relative safety within a sheltered small town in the mid-twentieth century. You will discover a time when sorority girls were virgins, baton twirlers mattered, and Elvis Presley&#39;s hips were the wildest thing on the block.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;P&gt;
Against the backdrop of groundbreaking musical environments from Memphis, Tennessee to the Mississippi Delta, you will share stories that follow Elvis and his rise to fame through the eyes of his Graceland neighbors in the small suburb of Whitehaven. The author&#39;s mother, a young girl who was as much a celebrity in this small town as Elvis, reveals never-before-shared photographs and stories that chronicle a town, an extraordinary man, and a time forever lost to history, each on the brink of explosion and change.&lt;/p&gt;" />
