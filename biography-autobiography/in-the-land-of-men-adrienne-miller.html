  <title>In the Land of Men - Adrienne Miller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the Most Anticipated Books of the Year:&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;Vogue,&amp;#160;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Parade,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;Esquire,&amp;#160;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bitch, and&amp;#160;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Maclean&amp;#8217;s&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; Book to Watch&amp;#160;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A fiercely personal memoir about coming of age in the male-dominated literary world of the nineties, becoming the first female literary editor of &lt;em&gt;Esquire&lt;/em&gt;, and Miller&#39;s personal and working relationship with David Foster Wallace&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A naive and idealistic twenty-two-year-old from the Midwest, Adrienne Miller got her lucky break when she was hired as an editorial assistant at &lt;em&gt;GQ &lt;/em&gt;magazine in the mid-nineties. Even if its sensibilities were manifestly mid-century&amp;#8212;the martinis, powerful male egos, and unquestioned authority of kings&amp;#8212;&lt;em&gt;GQ &lt;/em&gt;still seemed the red-hot center of the literary world. It was there that Miller began learning how to survive in a man&amp;#8217;s world. Three years later, she forged her own path, becoming the first woman to take on the role of literary editor of &lt;em&gt;Esquire&lt;/em&gt;, home to the male writers who had defined manhood itself&amp;#8212; Hemingway, Mailer, and Carver. Up against this old world, she would soon discover that it wanted nothing to do with a &amp;#8220;mere girl.&amp;#8221;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this was also a unique moment in history that saw the rise of a new literary movement, as exemplified by &lt;em&gt;McSweeney&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8217;s and the work of David Foster Wallace. A decade older than Miller, the mercurial Wallace would become the defining voice of a generation and the fiction writer she would work with most. He was her closest friend, confidant&amp;#8212;and antagonist. Their intellectual and artistic exchange grew into a highly charged professional and personal relationship between the most prominent male writer of the era and a young woman still finding her voice.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This memoir&amp;#8212;a rich, dazzling story of power, ambition, and identity&amp;#8212;ultimately asks the question &amp;#8220;How does a young woman fit into this male culture and at what cost?&amp;#8221; With great wit and deep intelligence, Miller presents an inspiring and moving portrayal of a young woman&amp;#8217;s education in a land of men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;The memoir I&amp;#8217;ve been waiting for: a bold, incisive, and illuminating story of a woman whose devotion to language and literature comes at a hideous cost. It&amp;#8217;s Joanna Rakoff&amp;#8217;s&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;My Salinger Year&amp;#160;&lt;/em&gt;updated for the age of&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;She Said&lt;/em&gt;: a literary New York now long past; an intimate, fiercely realist portrait of a mythic literary figure; and now, a tender reckoning with possession, power, and what Jia Tolentino called the &amp;#8216;Important, Inappropriate Literary Man.&amp;#8217; A poised and superbly perceptive narration of the problems of working with men, and of loving them.&amp;#8221;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8212; Eleanor Henderson, author of&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;10,000 Saints&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
