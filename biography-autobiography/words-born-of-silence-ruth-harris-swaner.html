  <title>Words Born of Silence - Ruth Harris Swaner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;There were sounds, though they did not come from Michaels bedroom. They were coming from outside. I ran to the window and saw Michael outside in the garden, crying and cold under a shivering moon. In the summer, he would sit in the garden for hours sifting dirt through his delicate fingers. But this night the ground was frozen. Michaels hands were almost frostbitten. We must put a lock on his bedroom door.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Words Born of Silence: Unexpected Gifts of Autism&lt;/i&gt; is a powerful story of one womans challenging journey with an autistic son. She finds her path made easier and her burden lighter when she is later joined by a friend on the same journey. As she deals with the challenges that her sons autism brings to her daily life, she begins another journey that is also life-defining: the gradual loss of her mother.
Through her poignant journal entries, she reveals her first discovery of the extent of her mothers illness and the daily demands of her sons illness. As her mother begins to fade rapidly, she turns to her faith to learn how to trust, to love, and to deal with lifes unexpected lessons." />
