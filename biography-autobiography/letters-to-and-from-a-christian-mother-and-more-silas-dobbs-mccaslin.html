  <title>Letters to and from a Christian Mother and More - Silas Dobbs McCaslin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ethics, morals, and society in general have been spiraling downward for more than 50 years. Life simply was different up through the 1940s and the decade that followed. Christian thought today is discredited on the university campus, and traditional Christian piety now is viewed by the majority of the public as old fashioned. Postmodernism has become entrenched. In Christian circles, the question often is asked: How does the unbeliever cope? As believing Christians, we know that the Word of God provides all of the answers. &lt;br /&gt;
Perhaps LETTERS TO AND FROM A CHRISTIAN MOTHER AND MORE will be of some assistance to both the believer and the unbeliever, who as the parent of a young child or children, or of young adult children, must advise and counsel that child as they navigate through their religious, social, and academic decisions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Terry L. Johnson stated that the letters are remarkable and show clearly what a devout and accomplished woman your mother was...They are wise and devotionally rich, and may deserve a wider readership. (From the Preface). &lt;br /&gt;
Dr. Johnson continued: Their literary quality was outstanding. More importantly, they were filled with sound, shrewd, bold, Biblical counsel for her boys, particularly in the years between the beginning of college and the birth of Si and Suzannes first child, Carey. I wanted to read more and became convinced that others, particularly parents, could benefit from hearing the strong counsel of a Christian mother to her beloved sons. (From the Foreword).&lt;/p&gt;" />
