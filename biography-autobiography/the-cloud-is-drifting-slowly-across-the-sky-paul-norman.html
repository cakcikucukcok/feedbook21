  <title>The Cloud Is Drifting Slowly Across the Sky - Paul Norman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Yes, the cloud is drifting slowly across the sky. My life is like that cloud, slowly drifting away. Theres nothing I can do about it; as the Bible says, man is appointed once to die. 
Someday, I will cast no shadow, and the cloud will have slowly gone beyond the horizon. Yes, the cloud is slowly disappearing.
The Bible tells us that our days are like a cloud that crosses the sky and slowly disappears.
Today, I am going back to the place of my youth where the cloud first appeared.
A certain amount of nervous anticipation began to funnel through my brain as the turnoff to my past approached. A beautiful multicolored leaf with its beautiful hues of green, gold, and red blew across my windshield. I do not need any more reminders that Father Time is slowly ticking away." />
