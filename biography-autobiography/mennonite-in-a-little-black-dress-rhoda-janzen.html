  <title>Mennonite in a Little Black Dress - Rhoda Janzen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A hilarious and moving memoir--in the spirit of Anne Lamott and Nora Ephron--about a woman who returns home to her close-knit Mennonite family after a personal crisis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not long after Rhoda Janzen turned forty, her world turned upside down. It was bad enough that her brilliant husband of fifteen years left her for Bob, a guy he met on Gay.com, but that same week a car accident left her with serious injuries. What was a gal to do? Rhoda packed her bags and went home. This wasn&#39;t just any home, though. This was a Mennonite home. While Rhoda had long ventured out on her own spiritual path, the conservative community welcomed her back with open arms and offbeat advice. (Rhoda&#39;s good-natured mother suggested she date her first cousin--he owned a tractor, see.) It is in this safe place that Rhoda can come to terms with her failed marriage; her desire, as a young woman, to leave her sheltered world behind; and the choices that both freed and entrapped her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Written with wry humor and huge personality--and tackling faith, love, family, and aging--&lt;i&gt;Mennonite in a Little Black Dress&lt;/i&gt; is an immensely moving memoir of healing, certain to touch anyone who has ever had to look homeward in order to move ahead.&lt;/p&gt;" />
