  <title>The Comics of Hergé - Joe Sutliff Sanders</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As the creator of &lt;i&gt;Tintin&lt;/i&gt;, Herg&amp;#233; (1907&amp;#8211;1983) remains one of the most important and influential figures in the history of comics. When Herg&amp;#233;, born Georges Prosper Remi in Belgium, emerged from the controversy surrounding his actions after World War II, his most famous work leapt to international fame and set the standard for European comics.

Broad views of his career describe how Herg&amp;#233; navigated changing ideas of air travel, while precise accounts of his life during Nazi occupation explain how the demands of the occupied press transformed his understanding of what a comics page could do. The next section considers a subject with which Herg&amp;#233; was himself consumed: the fraught lines between high and low art. By reading the late masterpieces of the &lt;i&gt;Tintin&lt;/i&gt; series, these chapters situate his artistic legacy. A final section considers how the clear line style has been reinterpreted around the world, from contemporary Francophone writers to a Chinese American cartoonist and on to Turkey, where &lt;i&gt;Tintin&lt;/i&gt; has been reinvented into something meaningful to an audience Herg&amp;#233; probably never anticipated.&lt;p&gt;Despite the attention already devoted to Herg&amp;#233;, no multi-author critical treatment of his work exists in English, the majority of the scholarship being in French.
