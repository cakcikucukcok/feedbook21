  <title>As the Crowe Flies - Kevin Crowe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is meant to inspire people, to teach a lesson of how perseverance, true grit, and persistence with the help of God can get them to the ultimate level of success. Kevin Crowe is a multitalented overachiever when you look at the life obstacles he has overcome. He is a native of Texas who moved to Colorado Springs at age three. He came from nothing; he was abandoned, unwanted, and unloved. He slept on floors as homeless people stayed at his house. He watched adults who were meant to guide and protect him do drugs, and, much worse, he watched his grandfather stab a man to death. Never did he think he would find himself in the same position as the man who lay on the ground later on in his adult life. 
Kevin became homeless at age fourteen due to his grandmothers overdosing on heroin and cocaine. Kevin is a rare statistic; he is one of the few people who beat the system. He was never put into a foster home, because he would run; he slept on streets and in Laundromats instead. He forged his way into high school at age seventeen. 
He was never in a stable environment until he was nineteen and was blessed to be asked to join the Thompson family. He graduated high school and graduated college from Kansas State University. 
Kevins story is meant to let all know they can beat the odds; their situations do not limit their potential. Kevin is a prime example of great things from humble beginnings." />
