  <title>A Name Engraved in Stone - Judith S. Lienhardt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is a story about a young man who had to grow up in a hurry.  Forest Shelburn Nelson was a soldier in World War II, an aerial gunner in a B-25 Mitchell medium bomber aircraft.  He fought the war in the sky.  This young teenager, who was competing in sports at high school, was now a man shooting down enemy planes.  This young man&#39;s life tragically ended at the tender age of twenty.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;His letters were very romantic, thoughtful, and loving.  It&#39;s difficult to witness the man, his plans, his hopes, his dreams, to just disappear in such a short time.  War&#39;s tragic consistent legacy remains that there is little more than a few medals on his chest, letters, or pictures to remember Forest by.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Forest&#39;s feelings about World War II; but I am sure he put every ounce of his being into fighting for his beliefs.  It makes no difference which war a loved one has fought in, there always someone who knows him or her a &quot;DEDICATED SOLDIER.&quot;  Whether your loved ones are dead or live, you are not alone!  We each have our private wars that we endure.&lt;/p&gt;" />
