  <title>Zoe &amp; Me Plus - Jason Savage</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Zoe &amp; Me Plus. What does that mean? This book was originally envisioned to be about a period in my life living with my bi-color Manx cat Zoe. I began to write just after she passed away on May 2, 2002. I&#39;ve worked on this book for thirteen years. It&#39;s now August 2015. As I wrote, I decided to make it a full fledged pictorial autobiography. This book includes over 1,500 photos, some dating back to the early 1900&#39;s.  Zoe and I are still a prominent feature. The Plus adds my parents, sister, friends, my other companion animals, and the wild animals with whom I worked, particularly tigers. I thank Dr. Michael Bleyman for his dedication to saving the tiger and educating me on that effort. You can read about the Tiger Preservation Initiative on the Zoe Foundation Web site at www.ZoeTigers.org.  If you purchase my book and don&#39;t have an EPUB reader, I recommend Sigil - sigil-ebook.com. It does a great job presenting the complete pages as written." />
