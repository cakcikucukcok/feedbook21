  <title>Everything I Know About Love - Dolly Alderton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;There is no writer quite like Dolly Alderton working today and very soon the world will know it.&amp;#8221;--&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lisa Taddeo, author of #1 &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestseller &lt;em&gt;Three Women&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;Dolly Alderton has always been a sparkling Roman candle of talent. She is funny, smart, and explosively engaged in the wonders and weirdness of the world. But what makes this memoir more than mere entertainment is the mature and sophisticated evolution that Alderton describes in these pages. It&amp;#8217;s a beautifully told journey and a thoughtful, important book. I loved it.&amp;#8221;--Elizabeth Gilbert, &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;Eat, Pray, Love&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;City of Girls&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The wildly funny, occasionally heartbreaking internationally bestselling memoir about growing up, growing older, and learning to navigate friendships, jobs, loss, and love along the ride&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to the trials and triumphs of becoming an adult, journalist and former &lt;em&gt;Sunday Times&lt;/em&gt; columnist Dolly Alderton has seen and tried it all. In her memoir, she vividly recounts falling in love, finding a job, getting drunk, getting dumped, realizing that Ivan from the corner shop might just be the only reliable man in her life, and that absolutely no one can ever compare to her best girlfriends. &lt;em&gt;Everything I Know About Love&lt;/em&gt; is about bad dates, good friends and&amp;#8212;above all else&amp;#8212; realizing that you are enough. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glittering with wit and insight, heart and humor, Dolly Alderton&amp;#8217;s unforgettable debut weaves together personal stories, satirical observations, a series of lists, recipes, and other vignettes that will strike a chord of recognition with women of every age&amp;#8212;making you want to pick up the phone and tell your best friends all about it. Like &lt;em&gt;Bridget Jones&amp;#8217; Diary&lt;/em&gt; but all true, &lt;em&gt;Everything I Know About Love&lt;/em&gt; is about the struggles of early adulthood in all its terrifying and hopeful uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;" />
