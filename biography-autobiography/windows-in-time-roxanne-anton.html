  <title>Windows in Time - Roxanne Anton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;I was the youngest child of ten raised during the years of &lt;i&gt;The Great Depression and World War Two&lt;/i&gt;. My book, &lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Windows In Time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt; is an overview of life growing up in the, as some call them, &lt;i&gt;The Good Old
Days&lt;/i&gt;. I invite the reader to step back in time and enjoy the good, bad, sad, happy and funny experience of yesterday. What follows is some personal background. I am married to a special man for many years. We were blessed with a son and daughter. They are grown now and we have three wonderful grandchildren. By now you probably know my major interest in life is my family. Next to them, my extended family,
friends and our community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My writing background includes publication in &lt;strong&gt;Outdoor Life Magazine&lt;/strong&gt;, 
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;Outdoor Life Deer Hunter&#39;s Yearbook 1987&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, a magazine &lt;strong&gt;Michigan 
Woman&lt;/strong&gt; and varied freelance business and technical writing. I retired from Xerox Corporation where I was a Senior Customer Representative; a liaison between customers and the Company, among other duties.&lt;p&gt;I retired early from Xerox to care for my aged mother and in laws. My life has been full. I enjoyed being a stay at home mom while my children were young. 
&lt;p&gt;I went back to pursue my educational interests the same year my eldest child began her college career and enjoyed a fulfilling career. I seem to find writing about my self the most difficult of all.&lt;/p&gt;" />
