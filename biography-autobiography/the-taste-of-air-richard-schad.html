  <title>The Taste of Air - Richard Schad</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;In 1999, Karyn Schad became the two hundreth woman in the world to be diagnosed with Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), a rare disease that mainly affects women of childbearing age. Muscle-like cells grew out of control in her lungs, stealing her breath away. She lived with the disease until finally receiving the gift of life, her new lungs on May 17, 2009, delivering her from the foggy line where life rubs shoulders with death.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;On their wedding day forty years before, neither Karyn nor Richard could possibly have foreseen the tremendous trial in their future.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Together, they found the courage to brave LAM, and are truly grateful for the wisdom they&#39;ve gained.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In this memoir, Richard shares their story, combining his recollection of events with Karyn&#39;s diary entries. He considers the joy they have now and the lessons they have learned from the experience--how it opened their eyes to the beauty surrounding them. Although the disease exploded in Karyn&#39;s body, it never touched her heart, and that&#39;s where hope lives.&lt;/P&gt;" />
