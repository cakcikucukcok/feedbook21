  <title>9 Voices - The Wilson Family</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It was at the Airplane Club in Denver, Colorado, right after World War II, that Leland, on the drums, and Josephine, handling the vocals, first met and fell in love. That marked the beginning of a long and fruitful lifeone that would include the births of nine children.
As the children grew up surrounded by family, they were the center of their own universe, and their home was the center of their community. Their upbringing was different than most, but the siblings found unique ways to entertain themselves and challenge their intellect, their musical talents, and their wiles.
In 9 Voices, each of the children, now grown, presents a chapter narrating events from his or her life, from his or her perspective; their stories encompass their childhoods, from their earliest memories to their departures from home. Their testimonies and colorful anecdotes pay tribute to their parents and an extraordinary childhood. Told from nine distinct viewpoints, this memoir shares a lively, touching, and candid portrait of one remarkable family." />
