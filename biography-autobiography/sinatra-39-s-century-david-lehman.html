  <title>Sinatra&#39;s Century - David Lehman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In celebration of his one-hundredth birthday, a charming, irresistibly readable, and handsomely packaged look back at the life and times of the greatest entertainer in American history, Frank Sinatra.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sinatra&amp;#8217;s Century&lt;/em&gt; is an irresistible collection of one-hundred short reflections on the man, his music, and his larger-than-life story, by a lifetime fan who also happens to be one of the poetry world&amp;#8217;s most prominent voices. David Lehman uses each of these short pieces to look back on a single facet of the entertainer&amp;#8217;s story&amp;#8212;from his childhood in Hoboken, to his emergence as &amp;#8220;The Voice&amp;#8221; in the 1940s, to the wild professional (and romantic) fluctuations that followed. Lehman offers new insights and revisits familiar stories&amp;#8212;Sinatra&amp;#8217;s dramatic love affairs with some of the most beautiful stars in Hollywood, including Lauren Bacall, Marilyn Monroe, and Ava Gardner; his fall from grace in the late 1940s and resurrection during the &amp;#8220;Capitol Years&amp;#8221; of the 1950s; his bonds with the rest of the Rat Pack; and his long tenure as the Chairman of the Board, viewed as the eminence grise of popular music inspiring generations of artists, from Bobby Darin to Bono to Bob Dylan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brimming with Lehman&amp;#8217;s own lifelong affection for Sinatra, the book includes lists of unforgettable performances; engaging insight on what made Sinatra the model of American machismo&amp;#8212;and the epitome of romance; and clear-eyed assessments of the foibles that impacted his life and work. Warm and enlightening, &lt;em&gt;Sinatra&amp;#8217;s Century&lt;/em&gt; is full-throated appreciation of Sinatra for every fan.&lt;/p&gt;" />
