He made his name as a front of camera reporter covering the news as it happened not only at home in Ireland but also on the International scene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During his career as a news journalist he reported on the upheavals of the Haughey/Fitzgerald years: Irish prime minister Charlie Haughey even once said jokingly that he was his favourite reporter.

An encouraging signal that it (the Supreme Court) also recognises that the public interest can be served by investigative journalism… The Supreme Court ruling should concentrate the minds of policy makers. They have obdurately refused to amend the State’s penal libel laws and seem content with a situation in which journalists operate within one of the most restrictive legal environments in the developed world.&#39;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charlie was subsequently involved in Ireland’s longest libel case. RTE and Charlie Bird won the case which had been taken by the Fianna Fail TD, Beverley Cooper Flynn. After that Charlie investigated a number of other bankings scandals including one involving foreign exchange over charging at Allied Irish Bank (AIB).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January 2009 he took up the post of Washington Correspondent with RTE News. He covered the election of President Obama and his historic inauguration in Washington which was attended by over two million people.&lt;/p&gt;" />
