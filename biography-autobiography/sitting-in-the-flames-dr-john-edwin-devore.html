  <title>Sitting in the Flames - Dr. John Edwin DeVore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As reviewed by New York Times best-selling author Ellen Tanner Marsh, In clear, heartfelt prose, DeVore describes a brave and unflinching confrontation with his past, made necessary in order for him to have a more meaningful future. War, he realized, isnt just one mans experienceits the sum total experience of an entire country. To stop wars, he argues, we must understand them and why we seem to need them.
The gut-wrenching brutality experienced by American soldiers in Vietnam was for many the beginning of a lifelong personal struggle. Unlike many veterans, who were unable to cope after returning to civilian life, John DeVore moved with facility from success as an Army officer to success in corporate America. Nevertheless, like many other veterans, the war haunted DeVore and finallyin a process he narrates in this bookcompelled him to make a commitment to free himself and our country from the addiction to war.
Joel Andreas, author of Addicted to War: Why the U.S. Cant Kick Militarism
John DeVores important book chronicles the remarkable transformation of a professional soldier to a spiritual warrior of peace. A must-read for those interested in exploring the possibilities of a less violent global future.
Manfred B. Steger, professor of politics and government, Illinois State University; research fellow, Globalization Research Center, University of Hawaii at Manoa
DeVore offers a simple explanation of the interconnectedness of his Western cultural conditioning, globalization, the reality of war, his civilian and military careers, and his search for spiritual roots. He certainly is a living example of the fearlessness and desire to help others that can begin to emerge through willingness to work with personal emotional turbulence, fear, anger, pride, envy, selfishness, ignorance, etc., on a daily basis. His story really helps us experience that it is possible to turn bad things to good things.
