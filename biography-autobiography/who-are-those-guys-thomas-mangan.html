  <title>Who Are Those Guys? - Thomas Mangan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Countless children, students, and adults have gone to Washington, D.C., to stand before the Vietnam Wall.
Many others have stood before traveling versions of the wall, but for those who did not lose someone special in the war, the experience might not be as meaningful as it is for others.
Thomas Mangan, a Vietnam veteran and longtime journalist, examines the lives of the Americans who died in the war and tells how they paid the ultimate price for freedom in this extensively researched handbook that reveals the people behind the list of names.
The book serves as a resource for teachers, schoolchildren, and anyone seeking to make their visit to the wall more educational, meaningful, and inspiring. By reading about those whose names are on the wall, youll approach it with a new perspective.
Whether youre a student, a teacher, soldier or a member of a veterans organization, youll gain a deeper appreciation for the freedom we enjoy from the stories of bravery and sacrifice in Who Are Those Guys?" />
