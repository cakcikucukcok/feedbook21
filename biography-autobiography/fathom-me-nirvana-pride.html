  <title>Fathom Me - Nirvana Pride</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Nirvana was ready for the world after finally being fed up of people taking advantage of her. All she ever wanted in life was to feel amazing, to have a happy family, and a husband who respected her mind, body, and time. It was time she finally stood up for what she wanted in life. Nirvana has always wanted to build her own empire and to create wealth for generations to come. It was only a matter of time before she made her dreams a reality.
Nirvana was finally feeling free and fabulous. She had managed to escape the constant abuse that her family had fed to her daily. She was living on her own terms and making her own money. She had landed a job with one of the hottest clubs in town, and nothing was going to stop her from stacking her chips. Even though it seemed that her life was fabulous, it was only a matter of time before she would face with new enemies while she was in the process of building her empire. 
Later, Nirvana got married to Devonta Pride, who had just enlisted into the military. She was excited because this was her chance to travel the world. Nirvana had made major life-changing alterations for Devonta to make him happy, not knowing that he would not be willing to do the same for her. Neither did she know the hurt she once suffered would eventually return." />
