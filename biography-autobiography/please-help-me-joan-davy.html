  <title>Please Help Me - Joan Davy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When I was 4 I remember walking on paving stones: avoiding the cracks, living in the moment with a nice clear mind. Grandma looked after me while my mother worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was 7 life changed when my mother married someone she hardly knew. I am taken to hell to live with them. I believe in hell. It was at Number 34. There was no grown-up to stop the deluge of abuse. A blanket is thrown over my mind and I hide under it. Worry and anxiety have seeped into my soul and there they stay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At sixteen I think I have been clever to get pregnant so I can marry and get away but I am trapped. I worry about what is happening with my half-sisters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At twenty my mind is not coping and I urgently need someone to help me but there is still no one to turn to. Thats the day a visitor enters my kitchen and lets me see something beyond my wildest imagination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can I tell you about it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every word is true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through my future life struggles I am told I can contact the visitor for help anytime. And I do. Often.&lt;/p&gt;" />
