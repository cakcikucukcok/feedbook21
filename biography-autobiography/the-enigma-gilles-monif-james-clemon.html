  <title>The Enigma - Gilles Monif, James Clemon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE ENIGMA&lt;/b&gt; is based on true life murder and its resultant court-marshal whose outcome challenges credibility.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;When a soldier is found murdered in Texas, two lesbian lovers who were with her on the night of her death are arrested. The one who actually did the crime accepts a plea deal to testify against her lover, an Army Specialist who sees herself as a man trapped in a womans body. She now must prove her innocence.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;While centering of a crime of passion with secrets, betrayals, and the legal battle, the book tells the story of a unique and complicated individual whose life situation ties into controversial, contemporary social issues.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The ENIGMA is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside the enigma reference. Its a murder (riddle) for a curious reason (the mystery) allegedly by an extraordinary complex individual (the enigma). Based on a true story, the real-life participants are painted as vividly as those who inhibit a fictional page-turner. The depth of character exploration, sociological observations, and military ways and means is stellar.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
