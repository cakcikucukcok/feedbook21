      <meta name="description" content="Karen Blixen&amp;#39;s&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Out of Africa&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;is the lyrical and luminous memoir of Africa that launched a million tourist trails.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In 1914 Karen Blixen arrived in Kenya with her husband to run a coffee farm. Instantly drawn to the land, she spent her happiest years there until the plantation failed. Karen Blixen was forced to return to Denmark and it was there in 1937 that she wrote this classic account of her experiences. A poignant farewell to her beloved Kenya, &lt;i&gt;Out of Africa&lt;/i&gt; describes her strong friendships with the people of her area, her affection for the landscape and animals, and great love for the adventurer Denys Finch-Hatton. Written with astonishing clarity and an unsentimental intelligence, &lt;i&gt;Out of Africa&lt;/i&gt; portrays an idyllic way of life that has disappeared forever." />
