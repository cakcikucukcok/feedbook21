  <title>Tide of Change - Hossca Harrison</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; Why the NBC Today Show, Seattle Times, Denver Post, Boulder Camera, Longmont Times, Time magazine, and many others find this man&#39;s story to be astounding.  Hossca Harrison in his own words writes, this book is not about phenomena, although phenomena are part of the story.  This book tells about an emotional journey between life and death that begins in Central America and ends in England.  It encompasses my journey through two near-death experiences over an eleven-year period.  This book is not about death, although death is part of the story.  Nor is this book about healing, although healing is a part of the story.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My life may seem full of pain and suffering.  Quite the contrary, it has been filled with experiences beyond the conscious conception of many.  I have had the opportunity to experience life beyond the dreams many people hold.  My life&#39;s story is not for the causal reader.  This story is for those who know there is much more to life than meets the eye.  My journey involves experiencing life beyond traditional beliefs - beyond traditional ways of thinking, creating, and healing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If someone had come to me in December of 1981 and forewarned me that before December ended, my life would end and begin again, that I would give up everything I thought to be true, including my business, my home, and my way of life, I would not have believed it possible.  I could not believe it.  My mind was very much entrenched in the illusions we make for ourselves in this reality.  My mind could not have dealt with the future I was about to embark upon.  Thankfully, no one told me what my future held.  If someone had and I had believed it, I would have hidden under the biggest rock I could find.
