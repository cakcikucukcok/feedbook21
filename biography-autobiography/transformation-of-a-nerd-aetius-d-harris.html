  <title>Transformation of a Nerd - Aetius D. Harris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Growing up in Chicagos South Side was not easy for author Aetius D. Harris, who went by Columbus George, or Colo, in the story, Poke Dog in his youth. Born in 1968, he chronicles his struggles to fit in among his peers and stay on a righteous path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his memoir, Harris details tales of his childhood and his experiences with the criminal life. He also recalls the spiritual fight that ensued for his soul. He is focusing on a period in his life from the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s. In that time, his god-fearing mother did her best with raising him. That being; he still found himself drawn toward the Black Disciples organizations love, structure &amp; protection, in that order!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This autobiography explores his progression from child to young adult. A journey driven by a will to survive, succeed and achieve goals. His obstacles are his skin color and his intellect. He uses his wits to maneuver the South side of Chicagos wickedness!&lt;/p&gt;" />
