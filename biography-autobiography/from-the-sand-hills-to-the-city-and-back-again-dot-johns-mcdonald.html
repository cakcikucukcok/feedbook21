      <meta name="description" content="This book is the memoir of a 79 year old woman who was a child and now is a Mother, Grandmother, and Great Grandmother.  Life now is very different than that documented here.  Although the present generation will look upon it as something that in their minds must be fiction.  However, it is in deed non-fiction.  A real story, about a real person,  in real space and  time.  Different, yes, but nonetheless real.  This story is very real to the author and those of whom and to whom she writes.  Many will read and identify immediately.  This story ends well.  Not all stories end as well.  It is that thought that gave the passion to bring the work to completion.  The author, a well aged Mother, Grandmother, and Great Grandmother, satisfied with her life as she not only looks back, but as she looks forward.  A life well lived, what most people desire for themselves and for that of their friends and family.  Reading this book will give the insight to how that can be a reality for all." />
