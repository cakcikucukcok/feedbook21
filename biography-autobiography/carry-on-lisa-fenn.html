Both young men were disadvantaged students with significant physical disabilities. Dartanyon Crockett was legally blind as a result of Leber&amp;#8217;s disease; Leroy Sutton lost both his legs at eleven, when he was run over by a train. Brought together by wrestling, they had developed a brother-like bond as they worked to overcome their disabilities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After forming a profound connection with Dartanyon and Leroy, Fenn realized she couldn&#39;t just walk away when filming ended; these boys had had to overcome the odds too many times.
