  <title>My Mother&#39;s Kitchen - Peter Gethers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;My Mother&#39;s Kitchen&lt;/i&gt; is a funny, moving memoir about a son&#39;s discovery that his mother has a genius for understanding the intimate connections between cooking, people and love&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peter Gethers wants to give his aging mother a very personal and perhaps final gift: a spectacular feast featuring all her favorite dishes. The problem is, although he was raised to love food and wine he doesn&#39;t really know how to cook. So he embarks upon an often hilarious and always touching  culinary journey that will ultimately allow him to bring his mother&#39;s friends and loved ones to the table one last time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The daughter of a restaurateur--the restaurant was New York&#39;s legendary Ratner&#39;s--Judy Gethers discovered a passion for cooking in her 50s. In time, she became a mentor and friend to several of the most famous chefs in America, including Wolfgang Puck, Nancy Silverton and Jonathan Waxman; she also wrote many cookbooks and taught cooking alongside Julia Child. In her 80s, she was robbed of her ability to cook by a debilitating stroke. But illness has brought her closer than ever to her son: Peter regularly visits her so they can share meals, and he can ask questions about her colorful past, while learning her kitchen secrets. Gradually his ambition becomes manifest: he decides to learn how to cook his mother the meal of her dreams and thereby tell the story of her life to all those who have loved her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With his trademark wit and knowing eye, Peter Gethers has written an unforgettable memoir about how food and family can do much more than feed us--they can nourish our souls.&lt;/p&gt;" />
