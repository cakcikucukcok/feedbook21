  <title>Journey of an Unknown Destination - JoAnn Havard Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As I look back on some of the things I did to keep from going to church, I have to laugh.  I would take my twin brother&#39;s and sister&#39;s only pair of shoes and hide them.  Back in those days my parents could only afford one pair of shoes.  I was hoping that my mother would let me stay home and baby sit.
Look at me now!  Married to a pastor, going to church all the time.  Is this God&#39;s way of reminding me not to hinder the little children.  After all, He does work in mysterious ways.  As I set out on life&#39;s journey of an unknown destination unsure of the path I would go, the most important thing one can do is always be true to oneself.  Remember, there&#39;s nothing that God cannot do.  So, start out today with faith in your heart, until your dreams come true!" />
