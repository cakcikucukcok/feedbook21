  <title>Love, Ellen - Betty Degeneres</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;Mom, I&amp;#39;m gay.&amp;#34; With three little words, gay children can change their parents&amp;#39; lives forever. Yet at the same times it&amp;#39;s a chance for those parents to realize nothing, really, has changed at all; same kid, same life, same bond of enduring love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twenty years ago, during a walk on a Mississippi beach, Ellen DeGeneres spoke those simple, powerful words to her mother. That emotional moment eventually brought mother and daughter closer than ever, but not without a struggle. Coming from a republican family with conservative values, Betty needed time and education to understand her daughter&amp;#39;s homosexuality -- but her ultimate acceptance would set the stage for a far more public coming out, one that would change history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Love, Ellen,&lt;/em&gt; Betty DeGeneres tells her story; the complicated path to acceptance and the deepening of her friendship with her daughter; the media&amp;#39;s scrutiny of their family life; the painful and often inspiring stories she&amp;#39;s heard on the road as the first non-gay spokesperson for the Human Rights Campaigns National Coming Out Project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a mother&amp;#39;s love, clear minded common sense, and hard won wisdom, Betty DeGeneres offers up her own very personal memoir to help parents understand their gay children, and to help sons and daughters who have been rejected by their families feel less alone.&lt;/p&gt;" />
