  <title>Troubled Path to Broken Medicine - R. Sabol</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;There is another patient being extracted from the other vehicle. They should be on their way in about thirty minutes.&quot; The charge nurse answered, &quot;I will be standing by.&quot;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;For Dr. Kirk Frei, this would turn out to be the worst shift of his ER career so far. He heard the radio and was thinking of what was happening with the first patient, what he would have to do.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly the radio crackled again. &quot;We have the second patient from the accident, whose BP is 70 palpable. He has got chest and abdominal injuries, and we think a lung is down on the right. An IV has been established, his heart rate is 132, and he is having trouble breathing. We will be there in five.&quot; &quot;Roger,&quot; said the charge nurse.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Holy Jesus, thought Dr. Frei. The first patient isn&#39;t here yet-a severe head injury that was called in earlier from an MVC, and they said it would be thirty minutes before this one would arrive. Now he would have to think and act fast. This book is a memoir of Dr.Sabol who was reared in a dysfunctional family,who overcame many adversities,disappointments,and heartaches and took a troubled path to becoming a physician after hard work and a career as an officer in the U.S.Marine Corps.This first book takes him from childhood to his entrance into the Marine Corps interspersed with medical cases that he has been a part.&lt;/p&gt;" />
