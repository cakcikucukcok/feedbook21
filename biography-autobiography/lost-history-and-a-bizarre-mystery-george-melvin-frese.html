  <title>Lost History and a Bizarre Mystery - George Melvin Frese</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Author George Frese was captivated as a young child by the new technology of his dayradio. When he was sixteen, he and a friend developed a crude form of radar that could detect airplanes. In fact, he got in trouble with the United States government when he tried to send his discovery to the British to protect them from being bombed by the Germans early in World War II. He thinks that that exchange was not forgotten by the government and provides some insight into a strange situation that he encountered while serving in the army.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;When George Frese joined the US Army following his graduation from college at the height of World War II, he kept encountering anomalies in the way he was treated. Once he finished advanced training, he was never assigned to any unit, and he never received any orders. He was always unattached and unassigned. Commanding officers consistently told him, Here is a job if youd like to volunteer for it, but I cant order you to do it.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Finally, he was sent to Europe, eventually making his way to Berlin after the war was over in Europe; there, he ran the long lines of communications that connected all of the allies across Europe. This marked the beginning of his adventures in post-war Germany.&lt;/P&gt;
