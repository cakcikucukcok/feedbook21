  <title>Robyn’S Life Journey - Robyn Robyn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Life is simple yet complicated &lt;br /&gt;
Join Robyn as she begins life in Australia; wonders about cannibals at the coffee plantation she visits; moves into a career in advertising, marriage, and motherhood; and then embarks on a quest for enlightenment. Life stages that we can all relate to (well, except for the cannibals in Papua, New Guinea). Yes, it is safe to say that these days, even the quest for enlightenment is becoming commonplace.&lt;br /&gt;
Robyn had a very comfortable lifestyle with a man she loved, yet she knew something was missing, and she could no longer ignore her desire to know God. Th e only problem for Robyn was that she didnt realize that was her goal. She only knew that her yearning for something beyond materialism had fi nally become overwhelming and couldnt be ignored any longer. And that is where the real fun begins. &lt;br /&gt;
Visions of past lives and even of saints left Robyn questioning her sanity. Luckily she had good friends who helped to point out the signposts that were leading her along. It is said that there are as many paths as there are people, and that is never more true than when we try comparing our life with anothers. Even if we follow the same teacher, we will all have a unique experience of the teachings.&lt;br /&gt;
Robyns asked for, and found, some profound teachers. Each had something important to pass on to her. One of her teachers came in the guise of an obnoxious travelling companion, another as a baby, and another as a boot-camp instructor. Other moments came through more traditional spiritual practises of meditation and mysticism. Robyns story shows us to value all the moments in our lives, for they all have significance.&lt;br /&gt;
Such is life; it is so simple,&lt;br /&gt;
Yet complicated.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;" />
