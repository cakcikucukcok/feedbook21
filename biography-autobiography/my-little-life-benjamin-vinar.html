  <title>My Little Life - Benjamin Vinar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Not every immigrant who came to America went from rags to riches. Benjamin Vinars parents grew up in comfortable circumstances in a town called Ostrog in the Ukraine, but their circumstances quickly changed with the bloody arrival of World War I and the Russian Revolution. They barely made it out alive, escaping to the United States, where they settled in Rock Island, Illinois.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benjamins parents often reminisced at the dinner table about the Ostrog of their youth, a largely Jewish community of roughly eight thousand souls. Meanwhile, their life in the American Midwest was a constant struggle. As a child Benjamin saw his father use all his strength to move iron stoves and massive oak furniture about his secondhand store to eke out a living. As Benjamin grew up, his peers deserted earlier ways, and the once-vibrant Jewish community declined as his generation deserted their grandfathers ways en masse. It was already fading out of existence by the time he went to law school. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;My Little Life&lt;/i&gt;, he breathes life back into whats been lost, celebrating his Jewish heritage and sharing an important historical account, while intricately exploring the mindset that his upbringing produced in him.&lt;/p&gt;" />
