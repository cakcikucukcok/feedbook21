  <title>The Truth About Trump - George A. Sorial, Damian Bates</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remember when Trump was a great boss, a great father, and a great businessman, before the liberal media rewrote that narrative? That&amp;#8217;s still the real Trump.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Longtime Trump Organization executive and attorney George A. Sorial saw the real Trump firsthand, from the early days of &lt;em&gt;The Apprentice&lt;/em&gt; to the passing of power to the younger generation before the inauguration. He learned from his boss how to use chaos, the media, and a single-minded focus to achieve things everyone else said were impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He learned how to predict what the world&amp;#8217;s least predictable leader would do next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The Real Deal&lt;/em&gt;, George A. Sorial and Damian Bates, a former newspaper editor who has covered Trump for years, explain the forty-fifth president&amp;#8217;s business and political strategies in detail. Often what looks complicated is just a man giving the people what he wants. For instance, why would Trump run for president, when winning would be a financial disaster for him? He was forced to set aside his TV contracts and international expansion, costing him hundreds of millions of dollars. The answer is: because everyone he talked to wanted him to run to make America great again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this book we see a man barely recognizable from the media&amp;#8217;s depiction. We see the deliberate and cunning reasons he scolds people, gets impatient with complicated briefings, hires neophytes, and starts fights in the media. We also see a boss who was hard-working, fun, well read, generous with opportunities, and endlessly interested in outside opinions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mainstream media has tried to undermine the president at every turn by spreading lies about his management abilities, his negotiation style, and his business success. Now, in &lt;em&gt;The Real Deal&lt;/em&gt;, George A. Sorial and Damian Bates explain how Trump&amp;#8217;s unusual style worked so well for decades&amp;#8212;and how it&amp;#8217;s working better in the White House than anyone realizes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;" />
