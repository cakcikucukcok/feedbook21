  <title>A Year in the Life of the Yorkshire Shepherdess - Amanda Owen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From bestselling author Amanda Owen come more tales of life at Ravenseat, the remote Yorkshire hill farm she shares with husband Clive, eight children and 900 sheep.  In &lt;i&gt;A Year in the Life of the Yorkshire Shepherdess&lt;/i&gt; she describes the age-old cycles of a farming year and the constant challenges the family faces, from being cut off in winter to tending their flock on some of Yorkshire&#39;s highest, bleakest moors - land so inaccessible that in places it can only be reached on foot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Writing with her trademark warmth and humour, Amanda takes us into her life as nine-year-old Miles gets his first flock, Reuben takes up the flugelhorn and she gives birth to a new baby girl. She is touched by the epic two-day journey of a mother sheep determined to find her lamb and gives a new home to an ageing and neglected horse. Meanwhile Clive is almost arrested on a midnight stakeout to catch a sheep-rustling dog and becomes the object of affection for a randy young bull. Funny, poignant and charming, &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Year in the Life of the Yorkshire Shepherdess &lt;/i&gt;is a must for anyone interested in the countryside and those who farm it.&lt;/p&gt;" />
