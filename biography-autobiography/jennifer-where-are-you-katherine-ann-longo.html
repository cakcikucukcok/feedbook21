  <title>Jennifer, Where Are You? - Katherine Ann Longo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In November of 1982, Katherine Ann Longos life changed forever. Her daughter disappeared. It was a mothers worst nightmare. When the authorities failed to solve the case, Kathy didnt take we dont know for an answer. She began her own investigation.  
In her opinion, she gathered strong supporting evidence that pointed to a viable suspect for the police. But even with what Kathy considered to be proof, the authorities refused to cooperate. The person she deemed responsible for her daughters disappearance went unquestioned. Even after she supplied them with photographic evidence, she couldnt get anyone to listen to her. 
What she was forced to endure in the course of her own personal investigation is chilling. Kathy was jailed, fired, and threatened. She was faced with sexual blackmail by those in authority, just for trying to get them to do their jobs. Hers was a terrifying descent into a world of deceit, pornography, child trafficking, and suicide. And for her efforts, she received a trip negotiated by the FBI into a state penitentiary.
Her family was threatened, her friends were harassed, and a newscaster actually lost his job for airing her story on TV. Police officials didnt appreciate the bad publicity they received and actively tried to discredit Kathy.  
But throughout this entire nightmarish event, the residents of Tampa, Florida, assisted Kathy in every possible way imaginable. This book is her thank-you to those people who didnt give up on heror Jennifer." />
