  <title>The Kojiki: Records of Ancient Matters - Basil Hall Chamberlain</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;B&gt;Written by imperial command in the eighth century, &lt;I&gt;The Kojiki: Records of Ancient Matters&lt;/I&gt; is Japan&#39;s classic of classics, the oldest connected literary work and the fundamental scripture of Shinto.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A more factual history called the &lt;I&gt;Nihongi&lt;/I&gt; or &lt;I&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/I&gt; (Chronicles of Japan) was completed in A.D. 720, but &lt;I&gt;The Kojiki&lt;/I&gt; remains the better known, perhaps because of its special concern with the legends of the gods, with the divine descent of the imperial family, and with native Shinto. Both works have immense value as records of the development of Japan into a unified state with a well-defined character. Indeed, even the mythological aspects were accepted as fact throughout most of subsequent Japanese history&amp;#8212;until the defeat and disillusionment of the nation in 1945.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This classic text is a key to the historical roots of the Japanese people&amp;#8212;their early life and the development of their character and institutions&amp;#8212;as well as a lively mixture of legend and history, genealogy, and poetry. It stands as one of the greatest monuments of Japanese literature because it preserves more faithfully than any other book the mythology, manners, language and traditions of Japan. It provides, furthermore, a vivid account of a nation in the making.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The work&lt;/div&gt;" />
