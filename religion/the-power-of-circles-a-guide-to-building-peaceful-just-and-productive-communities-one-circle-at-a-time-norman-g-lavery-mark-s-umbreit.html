  <title>The Power of Circles: A Guide to Building Peaceful, Just, and Productive Communities-One Circle at a Time - Norman G. Lavery, Mark S. Umbreit</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Communication is the key to all successful human interactions. In light of the expanding use of texting and other forms of electronic communication, we risk losing the personal, face-to-face meetings that have been the mainstay of positive relationships between individuals and groups for thousands of years.  Lavery shows how the circle process is a powerful tool for overcoming this worrisome situation, as it offers a way to enhance communications, build and rebuild relationships, and improve problem-solving capabilities within families, neighborhoods, schools, corporations, and civic organizations.    Narratives by participants in the Community Circles program attest to the capacity of people and groups to work together to resolve contentious issues, especially when they are provided with a safe place in which to tell their stories and be listened to by others--without judgment.  The circle process has been used successfully for thousands of years in indigenous cultures. With the help of the insights in this book, we now have the opportunity to use circles today to resolve many of the challenging issues that confront our society. The Power of Circles is a valuable guide for the journey ahead." />
