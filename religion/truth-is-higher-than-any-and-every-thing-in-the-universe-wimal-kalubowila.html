  <title>Truth Is Higher Than Any and Every Thing in the Universe - Wimal Kalubowila</title>
      <meta name="description" content="At present the world is full of non-Aryans and they all are living with following four negative visions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
1. Selfish or greedy thoughts.
2. Writhe or angry thoughts.
3. Living with Ignorance of universal Truths or facts.
4. Miserly or collecting thoughts always.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
All above negative visions are harmful to the self as well as the Nature. Due to this negative visions always tempt to think, talk, and act negative way. Those negative activities generate negative synergies automatically and store in the unconscious mind located out side of the body. Finally those negative synergies will create problems and Suffers in both lives of the individuals. In short it is the cause = effect reality or the law of nature in the universe forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Since there is no mind for the four matters those will not suffer at all. But all 33 kinds of beings are suffering due to above natural changing eternally. The mind has eternal life unless it segregated in to six parts. It is totally a paranormal or psychical process. The non diminishing positive synergy will provide the necessary power to this process completely. Once segregated the mind there would not be re-birth or death again. So this is the one and only strategy found by all 28 Buddhas born in this present world. That is the only way/path for complete eradication of all suffers and problems of self.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
All non-Aryans due to their ignorance of facts applying scientific and technological knowledge for mentally created problems and suffers. So it is irrelevant completely. Those artificial solutions are against the nature and not sustainable at all. Since those are against the nature the nature always tries to destroy and impose punishments on those individuals in both lives. All Gods, Brhammas, Buddhas also subjected to this Law of nature totally. So no one can mitigate or pardon any of those punishments at all. So it is useless for praying, making Pujas, Transferring merits, etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
All religions and philosophies in the world are bluffing and misleading totally for their negative living. Only the non-Aryans believe these false stories. All Aryans are totally rejecting those myths. I have tried to explain the real Truth with natural proof in this Book. I hope if you have the will and effort you could realized the Truth very easily. If not you could read my other Books also for more information." />
