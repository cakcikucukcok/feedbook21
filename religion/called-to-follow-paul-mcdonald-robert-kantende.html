  <title>Called to Follow - Paul McDonald, Robert Kantende</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As we walked up to the waterfall, the land was brown and dusty. When we arrived at the falls, everywhere the water touched was green and growing. In the same way, everywhere Jesus reaches, we see growth in dry situations. I hope that everywhere we went, we left behind life. During our clinics, I prayed to see with the eyes of Jesus and be his hands and feet to a desperate world. Well, that desperate world doesnt change when we leave Uganda. Even though we arent in Africa, we still need to be His eyes, hands and feet to everyone who sees us. Not just for big stuff like going to Uganda, but every day towards the people in our lives. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You dont need to be in Uganda to make a difference. You can do it right now, today, in your own home. Ask God how He can use you. Look for ways for people to see Jesus in everything you do. You will be astonished at what you discover. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Paul McDonald challenges and equips readers to walk in the fullness of their gifts and talents. Youll live a better life having read this book. &lt;br /&gt;
Margaret Feinberg, author of Flourish &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Paul is a wellspring of wisdom and a voice worth listening to. &lt;br /&gt;
Jonathan Merritt, contributing writer for The Atlantic and author of Learning to Speak God from Scratch &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Paul shares his struggles with doubt and frustration as he pursued a greater purpose and calling. Its never easy, and not always obvious, but following Jesus one step at a time will unlock greater meaning, adventure, and life than you can imagine. &lt;br /&gt;
