  <title>How Great Thou Art - Mellisand, Scribe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Greatest Stories Ever Written &amp; Retold by the Greatest Saints that
 	ever Walked upon the Earth. They Lived &amp; Evolved unto the Highest Exalted State of Sainthood, Having Experienced it in Absolution &amp;
 	Witnessed it in Oneness &amp; Do Testify to it, Here &amp; Now. These Truths are of the Divine Truth, which never changes. Mans Mind has to change
to Truth. It is about the Grand Plans of the Divine, as the Creator is of Oneness, in Grandeur &amp; Splendid Designs in Splendor. All of the
 Divine Creation is a Trinity of His Own Divinity that is for all Infinity. This is about Spiritual Awakening, the Second Coming. The First
 Is of the Flesh Garment. The Second is of the Spirit &amp; Spiritual (Soul Consciousness), which is Deathless &amp; Endless - Buried Alive within
Mans Body, to be Redeemed &amp; Resurrected unto the Soul of GOD, as His Loving Children, who are Translucent as He is. This is about His
 Immaculate Conception as the Holy Innocent Souls as Sinner are Transmigrated Souls to be Migrated or Vegetated. You will learn the real
 Story of the End Of the World (Revelation). The Divine Solution is Dissolution  sometimes called Maha (Great) Dissolution &amp; other times of
 all Lower Creation is destroyed, dissolved &amp; absorbed into nothingness. You shall learn the differences of the Yugas (ages of time)
 that are not counted in seconds &amp; days but in millions of years &amp; life span in hundreds &amp; thousands. All are recycled in order &amp; in the 
Lords Time. All recreation (not new) are reincarnated &amp; recycled in ages of time. It shall be about the All-Seeing Single Eye of GOD &amp; the 
Third Eye of the Soul. Why Vegetarianism? There shall be more unveiled &amp; revealed, unknown to be known to be about Atheists &amp; Agnostics  about Darkness &amp; about the Light of GOD." />
