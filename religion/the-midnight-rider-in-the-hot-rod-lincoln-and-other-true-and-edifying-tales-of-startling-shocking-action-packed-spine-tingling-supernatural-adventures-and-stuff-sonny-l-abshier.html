  <title>The Midnight Rider in the Hot Rod Lincoln and  Other True and Edifying Tales  of  Startling Shocking Action Packed Spine Tingling Supernatural Adventures and Stuff - Sonny L. Abshier</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The stories in this book are real-life, supernatural experiences in the life of one man. Some of the subjects brought up in relation to those events are sure to be provocative and maybe even to some controversial, but Sonny has taken care to back up from the Bible what he has written, to show that God can do whatever He chooses. The Lord spoke audibly to Sonny in 1974 while he was in jail and not interested in anything spiritual. Sonny had chosen crime as a lifetime career choice, but after literally seeing the light and being body slammed in that jail cell, his life has drastically changed, and the things that have happened in his life since then, to say the least, are very unusual and noteworthy. Although a lot is given to action, thrills and chills, deep and unheard-of subjects are brought to light and examined in detail in the light of the Word of God. Readers can expect inspiration, encouragement, and instruction with adventure, mystery, suspense, and thrills with a few chills.&lt;/p&gt;" />
