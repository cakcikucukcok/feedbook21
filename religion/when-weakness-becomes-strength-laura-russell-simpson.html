  <title>When Weakness Becomes Strength - Laura Russell Simpson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;And He said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for My strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. Therefore I take pleasure in my infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christs sake: for when I am weak, then I am strong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 Corinthians 12:910&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is through many years of personal experiences, struggles, and sufferings that God has brought forth this collection of writings. These are His words, not mine. Our sufferings are never wasted. Our weaknesses do become our strengths through His help. My prayer is that His words will encourage you, that He will reveal to you the times of weakness that made you strong, that you will see His presence with you as He carries you from your weaknesses to strength. May you experience His faithfulness to His words in 2 Corinthians 12:910.&lt;/p&gt;" />
