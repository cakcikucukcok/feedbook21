  <title>ReSourcing Theological Anthropology - Marc Cortez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Theologians working in theological anthropology often claim that Jesus reveals what it means to be &quot;truly human,&quot; but this often has little impact in their actual account of anthropology. &lt;em&gt;ReSourcing Theological Anthropology&lt;/em&gt; addresses that lack by offering an account of why theological anthropology must begin with Christology. Building off his earlier study on how key theologians in church history have understood the relationship between Christology and theological anthropology, Cortez now develops a new proposal for theological anthropology and applies it to the theological situation today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ReSourcing Theological Anthropology&lt;/em&gt; is divided into four sections. The first section explores the relevant Christological/anthropological biblical passages and unpacks how they inform our understanding of theological anthropology. The second section discusses the theological issues raised in the course of surveying the biblical texts. The third section lays out a methodological framework for how to construct a uniquely Christological anthropology. The final section builds on the first three sections and demonstrates the significance of Christology for understanding theological anthropology by applying the methodological framework to several pressing anthropological issues: gender and sexuality, race and ethnicity, and death and suffering&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;X&lt;/p&gt;" />
