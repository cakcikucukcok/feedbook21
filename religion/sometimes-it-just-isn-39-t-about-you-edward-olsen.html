  <title>Sometimes It Just Isn&#39;t  About You - Edward Olsen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When things are not going well, we&#39;ve all had those &quot;why me&quot; moments. Although I never saw battle or real physical danger when I was in the navy, I found myself in a situation, seemingly by fate, that became intolerable. It was a very rough time for me, eventually driving me to mental collapse. At the time I didn&#39;t think there might be a purpose to it. I was definitely in the &quot;Why Me!&quot; camp, just trying to survive a bad situation. But there was a purpose to it, not so much for me as it was for someone else.   Sometimes things happens to us; life gets rough, life is a struggle, more so than it seems it ought to be. If you find yourself in a situation like this, consider, perhaps, there might be a purpose to what is happening. You might be teaching someone else. Is there someone unseen looking out for us? All of us?   Or...is it all just chance?  Now, looking back I don&#39;t think it is all just chance. This is my story about how I learned that." />
