  <title>A Stroke of Love - Jasmine Alvarez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A Stroke of Love reminds you of how deeply loved you are by God and helps you witness our Saviors love and Gods relentless pursuit of the lost. You will be inspired to entrust all your cares to God and to live a life completely surrendered to Him. My hope is that God will use my story to encourage you to trust Him with all of your heart. Sometimes life can be so full and get so busy that we may forget that we have a heavenly Father who knows what we need even before we ask Him. I believe this is what happened to me, but because of Gods great mercy and love, He allowed me to experience a stroke that He used in a powerful way to bring me back to my First Love, Jesus Christ. No matter what we may experience in this life, we have a heavenly Father who loves us unconditionally and who always wants the best for us.  May the Lord open your heart to understand that you are His treasured and beloved creation! May you find your peace and rest in the sovereign care and warm embrace of the Almighty!&lt;/p&gt;" />
