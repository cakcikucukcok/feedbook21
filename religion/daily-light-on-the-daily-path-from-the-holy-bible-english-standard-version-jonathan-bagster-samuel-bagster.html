  <title>Daily Light on the Daily Path (From the Holy Bible, English Standard Version) - Jonathan Bagster, Samuel Bagster</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Read &lt;em&gt;Daily Light&lt;/em&gt; online at http://www.esvbible.org/devotions/daily-light.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As a child Samuel Bagster learned the precepts and practices of a devoted Christian, which sustained him throughout his life and which, in turn, he passed on to his children. This highly principled and religiously minded bookshop owner gathered his large family together daily for reading God&#39;s Word, testing their knowledge by connecting the day&#39;s verses with other passages, and praying over how it could be applied. It was from this practice of worship that the Bagster family compiled the material for &lt;em&gt;Daily Light on the Daily Path&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is said that this daily devotional book is the most popular of all time. It has touched hundreds of thousands of Christians to the remotest corners of the world with the biblical message of comfort and help. Originally printed in the 1800s, this work is timeless because each reading is a connection of Scripture verses centered around a theme. Crossway is delighted to re-release this classic book in the beautiful and clear language of the English Standard Version.&lt;/p&gt;" />
