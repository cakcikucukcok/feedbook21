  <title>Fear Nothing and Live the Extraordinary! - Maria Lopez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Fear Nothing and Live the Extraordinary is intended to help you see your privilege and responsibility as a Christian, to live up to your calling, and fulfill Gods extraordinary plan for your life.&lt;br /&gt;
Call to Me, and I will answer you, and show you great and mighty things, which you do not know. Jeremiah 33:3&lt;br /&gt;
We have been given the privilege to have part in the great commission to go, share the gospel, and make disciples! We ask the Lord time and time again to use us and transform us, but when He opens the door of opportunity to step out and grow our faith, many shy away, become fearful and ignore His call to live out His extraordinary plan and purpose for their life. &lt;br /&gt;
It clearly states in Scripture, Without faith it is impossible to please God. In other words without stepping out of our fear zone, it is IMPOSSIBLE to please God, let alone fulfill our purpose as a Christian in a world that so desperately needs to know the love of God.&lt;br /&gt;
To fulfill our God-given purpose, we must discover the awesome truths of confidence, strength, wisdom and great love the Bible teaches us, so we can say with boldness, &lt;br /&gt;
HERE AM I LORD, SEND ME!" />
