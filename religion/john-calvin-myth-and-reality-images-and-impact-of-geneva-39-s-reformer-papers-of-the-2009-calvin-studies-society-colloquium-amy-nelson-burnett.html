  <title>John Calvin, Myth and Reality: Images and Impact of Geneva&#39;s Reformer. Papers of the 2009 Calvin Studies Society Colloquium - Amy Nelson Burnett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The chapters in this volume were originally presented as papers at the 2009 colloquium of the Calvin Studies Society, held to mark the five-hundredth anniversary of John Calvin&#39;s birth. They offer a fresh evaluation of Calvin&#39;s ideas and achievements, and describe how others--from his contemporaries to the present--have responded to or built upon the Calvinist heritage. This book dispels popular misperceptions about Calvin and Calvinism, allowing readers to make a more accurate assessment of Calvin&#39;s importance as a theologian and historical figure. Contributions address areas in which Calvin&#39;s legacy has been most controversial or misunderstood, such as his attitude toward women, his advocacy of church discipline, and his understanding of predestination. These essays also give a nuanced picture of the impact of Calvinism by taking account of both the positive and negative reactions to it from the early modern period to the present.  Part 1: Calvin: The Man and His Work Part 2: Appeal of and Responses to Calvinism Part 3: The Impact of Calvin&#39;s Ideas" />
