  <title>Prayers of God’S....Powerful Women - Donna Drake</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;My desire is for everyone to understand we serve a mighty God, who does miracles today! We humbly share these answered prayers. All the Glory belongs to God and Him alone!  Pray for Gods will, have faith, and you will receive amazing answers to your prayers. As you read this book, prepare to experience Gods transforming love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
~Donna DD Drake, author of &lt;i&gt;Journal Your Prayers Praying Women&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First Thessalonians 5:17 says, Never stop praying (NLT). So if youre wondering Do I need to pray twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week? The answer is yes! Praying is a constant connection between you and God. The more you interact with Him, the closer your relationship grows. You will be blessed by Gods empowerment as you trust Him. Donna has devoted herself to minister to the body of Christ teaching and focusing on the unique approach of prayer. Her book Prayers of GodsPowerful Women is a tool designed for those who are serious about their journey as disciples following Christ!&lt;br&gt;
~Rev. Elizabeth Lee, Founder of Oklahoma Native Womens Ministry&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Donnas insights into the power of prayer are both inspiring and amazing. Her real-life testimony to miracles from the prayer of an earnest, godly woman encourages us to practice the power of prayer each day. &lt;br&gt; 
~Anita Kelley, author of &lt;i&gt;Dont Give Up! Help for Beginning Again&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Donna is a powerful praying woman who&#39;s seen God&#39;s mighty hand move mountains in people&#39;s lives. This book will inspire, challenge, and move all who hunger for a deeper relationship with Christ. &lt;br&gt;
~ Anita Parker, Minister of the Gospel&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow! I always knew my longtime friend Donna was an amazing woman of God! Donnas book on prayer just reaffirms she was born with an awesome anointing on her life. This is a must read book of encouragement for every Christian.  &lt;br&gt;
