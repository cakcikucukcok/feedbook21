  <title>Educating Ethical Leaders for the Twenty-First Century - Walter Earl Fluker, Walter E. Massey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The contributors to this book address the theme of educating ethical leaders for the twenty-first century. They represent a wide range of fields, including philosophy, theology, law, science, and medicine. They all share the belief, however, that ethical leadership education is necessary in order to provide the next generation of leaders with the tools that they will need to successfully navigate the challenges of today and of the coming decades. These essays identify significant issues and challenges confronting leaders, students, and educators from many different backgrounds, cultures, and communities, who must negotiate the difficult matters of tolerance, respect, and appreciation of difference; and the development of ethical student leaders and educators within specific environments, who will promote habits and practices that create communities of discourse and practice that address the challenges of diversity and culture.  Contributors:  Derek Bell Walter Earl Fluker Shirley Ann Jackson James A. Joseph Melvinia King Preston King Bryant Marks Walter E. Massey David Satcher Tavis Smiley" />
