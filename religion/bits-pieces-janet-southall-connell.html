  <title>Bits &amp; Pieces - Janet Southall Connell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Bits &amp; Pieces has been a tool for understanding myselfa more peaceful me. Writing this book has allowed me to open doors to discover more of who I am. I have had experiences, shifted ideas, sorted facts, discovered some of my beliefs and brought together some of my ideas about biology and spirituality. My hope is that others might find more self-understanding, more self-realization from sharing my story. We just might discover we are more alike than different. I was feeling so crazy, detached and miserable, with anxiety galore. &lt;br&gt;
About three years ago I was searching for a feel-better place. Among all the modalities I tried, I walked into a Center for Spiritual Living, thinking this might be an answer. At the time it was an unconscious choice, walking this spiritual path, but now its a conscious choice. I knew I didnt like feeling this crazy, and that was a motivator for me, an inertia buster, as I call it. I have had shifts of consciousness, observed different viewpoints and I have totally changed my ideas of how things work. A transformation, my evolution in consciousness. &lt;br&gt;
Because of my personal and our collective consciousness, a spiritual path may not be what we think, because things arent always as they seem. Its all in our views and our beliefs. The destination, unknown to me at the time, was to walk a spiritual path. My life journey consisted of experiences, that allowed me to reach my current understanding about life. I have realized that we are following our destiny all the time, creating life on the go. The best way is to become aware, we become empowered making it a better journeya better life for me and for you. &lt;br&gt;
And the journey continues&lt;br&gt;
