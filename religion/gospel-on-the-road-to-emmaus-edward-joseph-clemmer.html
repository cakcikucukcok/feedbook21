  <title>Gospel (On the Road To) Emmaus - Edward Joseph Clemmer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Born in Indiana, Dr. Edward J. Clemmer is a social psychologist by profession.  He now lives with his Maltese wife, Jane Zammit, and enjoys dual citizenship with Malta.  His four sons by a previous marriage continue to live in America.  His personal journey with the Lord into this Gospel (on the Road to) Emmaus began in a moment of grace on 12th September 2003, as Ed was on his way to the priest. The context for this initiation was the Feast of Exultation of Holy Cross (14th September), as the source of every grace is derived from the sacrifice of Jesus Christ on the cross.  The gospel is explained for us as the author and reader journey with the Lord as potential disciples.  Our journey begins at Bethany near the Jordan with John the Baptist preaching and baptizing.  Part 1 continues up to the Transfiguration of Jesus.  Volume One reaches its climax before the Lords final journey to Jerusalem, when Jesus returns to Bethany where the Baptist had preached.  Volume Two resumes with the Lords healing and preaching at Bethany near the Jordan.  Part 2 concludes in Bethany near Jerusalem with the Lords dinner celebration with Lazarus, after Jesus had raised Lazarus from the dead.  This celebration anticipates the Lords death and resurrection, and ours in Christ.  Part 3 takes up the Grand Liturgy of the Lords New Creation, with Holy Week.  The book initially concludes with a retrospective of the incarnation, of Jesus as God-with-us, and with the parallel coming of the Spirit at Pentecost.  Then, in the Part 4 conclusion of this gospel, our post-Emmaus journey with the risen Lord returns to our post-Pentecost life in the Holy Spirit.  The authors seven-year personal journey through this Gospel Emmaus ends in 2010 with the Feast of Sukkot, just as when the Lord also had anticipated the Holy Spirit.  But the Lord provides us with his own conclusion: although he had healed ten lepers as they were on their way to the priest, only one had returned to give thanks.&lt;/p&gt;" />
