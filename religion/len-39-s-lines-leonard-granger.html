  <title>Len&#39;s Lines - Leonard Granger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The ancient and honorable sport of angling is what Lens Lines is all about. Fishing with its roots deep in the past and its traditions continuing to the present, provides us with a constant source of challenging stories. We hope you will find them interesting, and maybe even amusing at times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a real honor to write for this newspaper again, after some ten years since the last Lens Lines column. During that time I was taking care of my wife on a 24/7 basis, operating the farm, and continuing the wholesale fishing tackle business. It has been six months since she went home to be with the Lord and she said she would be there waiting for me. I told her the rest of my days I would try to live a life helping others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lens Lines format has changed on April 1, 2011. While the stories are still about fishing they are no longer about fishing for fish. Now the stories hopefully will appeal to bringing Christians of all denominations back to churches in our area. The churches in California are only seeing some three percent of the population in church on Sunday. It is our prayer God will speak to you and join us in the church of your choice. If you want to reach me my address is Granger339@aol.com. Story ideas are most welcome as we share Gods Good news.&lt;/p&gt;" />
