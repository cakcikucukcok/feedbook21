  <title>Forty Days of Fasting &amp; Prayer in the Biblical Context - Clifford N. Opurum</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This spiritually-empowered book reveals the importance and power of fasting and prayer backed with faith in God.  It is based on the authors spiritual experiences and observations within Christ-centered environment, and written under the influence of the Holy Ghost and with the wisdom, knowledge and understanding received from the Almighty God.  Jesus said to his disciples: Howbeit, this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting (Matt 17:21).  There is an increasing need for believers to have a closer relationship with God, given the ever increasing level of abominations and immoralities in this world.
This book is meant to spiritually encourage believers to continue to intercede for the sick and the weak, the lost and the hopeless, and the unbelieving souls.  Throughout the Scriptures, and indeed the history of humanity, true servants of God have fasted and prayed as they faced circumstances that were above and beyond human comprehension and capability, and as they were over-whelmed with trials and tribulations of this secular world.  It is imperative that we find time for a quiet moment within our hearts to commune with God, and to have a dialogue with Him in our individual war rooms.
This book will immensely help and encourage you in positioning yourself for a place in the Kingdom of God." />
