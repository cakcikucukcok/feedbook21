  <title>Evangelicalism and the Decline of American Politics - Jan G. Linn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Beginning in the 1970s evangelical Christians decided to become involved in our nation&#39;s political life by becoming Republican partisans. Today they are widely considered the Republican Party&#39;s most reliable constituency. In the process American politics has become more bitter, chaotic, divisive, and now dysfunctional. There is a significant bipartisan consensus that the Republican Party bears the most responsibility for the state of our nation&#39;s politics. This is not an endorsement of Democratic policies, only an assessment of why our government no longer gets anything done. What is often ignored, though, is the role evangelicals are playing in what is happening. This book connects the dots between evangelical theology and evangelical politics. The key factor in both is their &quot;no compromise&quot; attitude that sees negotiations as a betrayal of moral principles, confident as they are that they are doing God&#39;s work here on earth. The result, as this book shows, is bad politics and bad religion, both of which are out of step with the views of most Americans. It concludes with suggestions for what the nation and evangelicals themselves can do to open the door to our government being able to function again, and to the nation healing some of its divisions." />
