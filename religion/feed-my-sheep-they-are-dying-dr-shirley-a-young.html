  <title>Feed My Sheep, They Are Dying - Dr. Shirley A. Young</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The writing was a journey into the field of leadership, to introduce new constructs for improving behaviors and attitudes of organizational leaders.  The media portrays a dynamic influence for the topic of servant leaders and not leaders benefiting extensive data about types of leaders from general, spiritual, to servant leadership. Metaphorically, if you take a glimpse into a faith-based organization, you will view the composition of a shepherd and sheep of about two thousand that require training with teaching.  The twenty-first century gives a view through new lenses, revealing the church to have sheep scattering, some slowly dying with possibly uncalled shepherds.  The faith-based organization is falling short of Gods Christlike representatives (servant leaders).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author did an exemplary job for leadership character traits that embody skills, which if applied properly will render a leader of excellence.  The resource reflects the authors conclusion to her research that servant leaders in faith-based organization serving God should influence excellence.  The publication is invaluable to transform aspiring and prospective servant leaders to image traits and practices of Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Fred Burrell, PhD, religious counsel, Trinity Theological Seminary, Newburgh, Indiana&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Young has compiled some noteworthy evidence and research on the ideal type of transformational leadership called Servant Leadership and applied it where it is needed the most: faith-based organizational leadership. I am proud to have mentored this fine scholar as she reached for her very meaningful dreams and turned them into a reality at the completion of her earned doctorate degree.&lt;/p&gt;
