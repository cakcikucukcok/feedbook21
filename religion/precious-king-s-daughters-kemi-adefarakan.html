      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Do you feel broken, condemned, worthless, lost and unable to see beyond your past? Do you believe your past has disqualified you from becoming the woman God created you to be? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are very valuable to Goddespite the mess that your life may be right now, despite the ugliness that you may see in your life, and despite everything that you feel right now. God wants you standing tall and beautiful. He wants you to be an example of His mercy, grace, and love. He wants you to radiate His glory and beauty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God is able and willing to take what may be broken, and put it back together. He takes what may seem worthless and restores its worth. He takes what may be dirty and old, and He washes and cleans it up to become new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our trash is Gods treasure. We throw people away when we reject, condemn, and judge them, but what we dont realize is that we are all Gods treasure. We may have been discarded by others, but God will never discard us. He creates only masterpieces, unique works of art that are meant to be treasured because of their great worth. You are a designers originalHis masterpiece. Dont let people tell you that you have made too many mistakes or done too many ungodly things and that you have become trash. No matter what you have done in your past. Nothing can change who you are or how He sees you-You are and will always be His daughter.&lt;/p&gt;" />
