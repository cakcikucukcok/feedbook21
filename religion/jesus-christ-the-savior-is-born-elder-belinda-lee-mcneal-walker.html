  <title>Jesus Christ the Savior Is Born - Elder Belinda Lee McNeal-Walker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book provides a captivating overview of the true birth of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. Each word is inspired by the Holy Spirit, leaving no opportunity for the desires of the flesh, false doctrine, or traditional thinking to intervene.  
The Holy Bible provides explicit details concerning the birth, life, and death of Christ. However, his true purpose has been altered by many false teachings, doctrines, and traditional generational customs based on lies, trickery, and deceit, which have ultimately resulted in death. The Bible declares in Romans 6:23, For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. His purpose is no secret to those who believe and receive. 
This inspired work is the alpha of a series entitled The Divine Collection for Christ. The purpose of this work is to break the traditional generational customs and provide our children, teens, as well adults, with the truth. As you read this book, allow the Holy Spirit to minister to your heart. As the truth is revealed, take a moment to receive Jesus as your personal savior and repent of any and all sins, including the sin of idolatry associated with false teaching, doctrine, and worship that may have cultivated your life.
As children of the Most High God, we are mandated to share the good news of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Our children deserve the truth. The appointed time has come to break the traditional generational customs of lies. The Bible declares in Ephesians 6:4, And, ye fathers provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. The future of our children rest on the foundation that we build for them today. This foundation must be built on truth and not on traditional generational customs." />
