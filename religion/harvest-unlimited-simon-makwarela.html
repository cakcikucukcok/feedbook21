  <title>Harvest Unlimited - Simon Makwarela</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Reverend Simon has emerged with a hit, and I believe it will take the world by storm. Harvest Unlimited is highly recommended for both Church leaders, believers in general and community leaders in pursuit of strategic soul winning.
Dr Elijah Maswanganyi, founder of Christ is the Answer Global Ministries, 
author of 35 books, RSA
In a seasoned approach, we are reminded not to witness His gospel out of duty but out of worship toward God. Harvest Unlimited is a must-have book for every local church and community.
Bishop Benjamin Dube, International gospel music maestro, 
senior pastor and founder of High Praise Centre, RSA
Your bookshelf is incomplete without a copy of Harvest Unlimited.
Dr Maxwell A. Masakona, author of Turning your Breakdowns into your Breakthroughs, senior pastor and founder of Calvary Christian Churches International, RSA
Harvest Unlimited oozes passion and carries a sense of urgency embodied in a cutting edge. I find it Holy Ghost inspired, challenging and revelatory.
