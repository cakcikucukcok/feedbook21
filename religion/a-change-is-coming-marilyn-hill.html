  <title>A Change Is Coming - Marilyn Hill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Christopher Watkins is a Christian, a criminal defense lawyer, hardworking, a faithful husband, and a devoted, loving father. Sarah Watkins is a socialite, stay-at-home mother, and fund-raiser; she enjoys being taken care of and has been married to Christopher for fifteen years. They have two sons, Monty and Trey, who love the game of football. Christophers youngest son Treys football injuries begin to unravel some deep family secrets. There is truth to the saying, Whats done in the dark will come to light.
The Watkins family is known for their notoriety, bourgeois demeanor, and riches. Christopher and his sister, Mindy, were adopted into the family. They were raised by Thomas and Beatrice Watkins. Christopher has always felt special and loved by his adopted parents. Mindy has managed to keep him grounded since their reunion and the death of their biological mother. Christopher vowed to make changes in his marriage and spend more time with his sons. In the process of making changes in his life, Christopher begins to learn who he really is. He was raised to be a certain person. But the truth eventually comes out, and he starts to believe his life is a lie. Christopher begins a journey on the road to discovery of his real self. Will the revelation and the pain of his past make him stronger? Will it destroy him? Or will Christophers faith in God bring him full circle with his life and peace in the end?" />
