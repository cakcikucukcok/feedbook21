  <title>Already Missional: Congregations as Community Partners - Bradley T. Morrison, Rob Dalgleish</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Your congregation is teeming with people already doing community ministry. They just don&#39;t know it yet. This book knocks down the church walls that keep parishioner ministry hidden from congregational view. Do parishioners know that their already-mission counts as ministry in your congregation?   Parishioners are already on mission raising their children, caring for elderly parents, volunteering in the community, supporting neighbors in crisis, serving on charity boards, donating to food banks, and fundraising for important causes. This book counts this already-mission as Christian service.   When parishioners sacrifice their time, talents, and treasures to be the good news for others, they are on mission for God. Even if they don&#39;t know it. Already missional congregations help people connect their personal mission with their faith. Already missional congregations see parishioners as community partners in ministry. This book provides the steps needed to connect your congregation&#39;s mission strategy with the rich and varied already-mission lived daily by parishioners.   Already Missional is your congregation&#39;s guide to being a community partner." />
