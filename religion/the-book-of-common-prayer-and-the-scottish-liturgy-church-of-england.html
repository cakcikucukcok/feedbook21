  <title>The Book of Common Prayer and The Scottish Liturgy - Church of England</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Book of Common Prayer is the short title of a number of related prayer books used in the Anglican Communion, as well as by other Christian churches historically related to Anglicanism. The original book, published in 1549 in the reign of Edward VI, was a product of the English Reformation following the break with Rome. The work of 1549 was the first prayer book to include the complete forms of service for daily and Sunday worship in English. It contained Morning Prayer, Evening Prayer, the Litany, and Holy Communion and also the occasional services in full: the orders for Baptism, Confirmation, Marriage, &amp;quot;prayers to be said with the sick&amp;quot;, and a funeral service.&lt;br /&gt;
It also set out in full the &amp;quot;propers&amp;quot; (that is the parts of the service which varied week by week or, at times, daily throughout the Church&amp;#39;s Year): the introits, collects, and epistle and gospel readings for the Sunday service of Holy Communion. Old Testament and New Testament readings for daily prayer were specified in tabular format as were the Psalms; and canticles, mostly biblical, that were provided to be said or sung between the readings.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Church of England is the established church of England. The Archbishop of Canterbury is the most senior cleric, although the monarch is the supreme governor. The Church of England is also the mother church of the international Anglican Communion.&lt;br /&gt;
It traces its history to the Christian church recorded as existing in the Roman province of Britain by the third century, and to the 6th-century Gregorian mission to Kent led by Augustine of Canterbury." />
