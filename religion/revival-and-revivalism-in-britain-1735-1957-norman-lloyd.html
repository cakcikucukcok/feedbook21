  <title>Revival and Revivalism in Britain 1735-1957 - Norman Lloyd</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Two or three centuries ago, Christian Churches regarded Revivals of Religion by the Holy Spirit, rather than human endeavours, as the normal and expected way of fulfilling Christ&amp;rsquo;s promise to build His Church, for these then occurred at regular intervals. However, many years have now passed since Britain experienced such a spiritual Awakening and the memory of them has been largely lost.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Yet perhaps nothing is more important to improve the spiritual life of the Church at the present time to remind ourselves of what God has done in the past and for Christian Churches and all Christians to everywhere pray, in the words of the Psalmist, &amp;ldquo;Will you not revive us again that your people may rejoice in you? Psalm 85:6&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I would like first to state what I mean by revival as witnessed in the Hebrides. I do not mean a time of religious entertain-ment, with crowds gathering to enjoy an evening of bright gospel singing; I do not mean sensational or spectacular advertising &amp;ndash; in a God-sent revival you do not needs to spend money on advertising. I do not mean high-pressure methods to get men to an enquiry room &amp;ndash; in revival every service is an enquiry room; the road and hillside become sacred spots to many when the winds of God blow. Revival is a going of God among His people, and an awareness of God laying hold of the community. Here we see the difference between a successful campaign and revival; in the former we may see many brought to a saving knowledge of the truth, and the church or mission experience a time of quickening, but so far as the town or district is concerned no real change is visible; the world goes on its way, but in revival the fear of God lays hold upon the community, moving men and women, who until then had no concern for spiritual things, to seek after God.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
