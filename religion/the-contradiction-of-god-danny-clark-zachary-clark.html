  <title>The Contradiction of God - Danny Clark, Zachary Clark</title>
      <meta name="description" content="God doesn&#39;t think like you.  That&#39;s your first big problem.  And you don&#39;t think like God.  That&#39;s your second big problem.  And to hear God tell it - the difference is not even close.  And that&#39;s your biggest problem of all:  &quot;For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the Lord. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts higher than your thoughts&quot; (Isaiah 55:8-9).  In an object lesson so big that only a measurement of all existing matter and space could provide an adequate point of comparison, God juxtaposes the way He thinks with the way you think, and formally announces His astonishing conclusion:  &quot;My thoughts are not your thoughts.&quot;  But then again, that&#39;s just the way God tells it.  You, of course, may disagree.  Apparently, most people do." />
