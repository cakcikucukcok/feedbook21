  <title>Blueprint - Jr McElfresh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the beginning, before anything was created, God crafted the plan for all that was to come. He established rules necessary for the plan to work perfectly. Two distinct concepts came into play: Gods Law of Disintegration and SE=MC2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Blueprint, author JR McElfesh delves into these concepts and discusses their purpose and how they apply to todays spiritual world. He:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;looks at how abstract things are impacted by many forces, including time and space, and he shows how God thinks, why he made the rules, and why they were necessary; draws some conclusions as to how spiritual and/or metaphysical abstracts are impacted by our thinking and the consequences of time and space; probes into the issues of God, creation, and how many things interact, how God uses them, and his final purpose; and  offers ideas about how things in time and space react to stress and the forces of our physical world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blueprint communicates that Gods Law of Disintegration is the spiritual counterpart to all the laws that govern the universe, and its important for Christians to stay on the right side of the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Praise for Blueprint McElfresh combines imaginative story-telling and examples from Christian history to support his arguments for Gods Law of Disintegration. Readers interested in serious Bible story, biblical theology, systematic theology, and Christian apologetics will find this new book a solid and provocative presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
