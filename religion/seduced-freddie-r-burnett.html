  <title>Seduced - Freddie R. Burnett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Award-winning author Freddie R. Burnett pens a masterpiece of endearment, mystery, adventure, and love. He delves into a sensitive subject with finesse and compassion. The childhood cruelty of his main character, Michael Fly, is the plot of the story.  Exiled and disgraced and badly beaten, from his hospital bed his story begins while he suffers amnesia from a terrible beating. His elusive past haunts him, and his present situation of being a murder suspect besets him, but his future is paved with gold. Sibling rivalry damages his manhood. His mother writes a degrading letter about him to the family that terrifies him. His father hates his son that doesnt measure up to his expectation. When there is no one to protect him, he learns about Jesus Christ, and he comes to his rescue every time.  His world is a bitter mixture of confusion, betrayal, and deception. He perseveres in his dream of being a marine and receiving his inheritance on his twenty-first birthday. He begins his recovery in Chicago where his Uncle Isaac Fly brings him to mend. He is in search of love, himself, and his manhood. The fast-paced city life offers excitement, but he is soon to become a prize for his double-crossing Uncle Isaac and the call girl he falls in love with and marries. She brings him to the end of himself and his confusion. He has to learn the lessons of what it means to love and to forgive. He learns what true freedom means. He triumphs through the twists and turns of his broken world with the courage necessary to face and free himself from his past. He gives us a truer meaning of seduced. He has inspired us all with a work of courage, revelation, and love. It will seduce you with love.
It shines a ray of light on the dark side of humanity." />
