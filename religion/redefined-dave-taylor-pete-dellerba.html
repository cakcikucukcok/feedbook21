  <title>Redefined - Dave Taylor, Pete Dellerba</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Defining momentswe all have them.  All of us can look back and remember moments when events occurred and decisions were made that drastically altered the course of our lives.  Defining moments shape our perception of the world, and they become major forces in defining who we are and what we are capable of.  They become the scales by which we measure our worth.  Our reality is anchored in our interpretation of those moments, and how we respond to them often determines how we respond in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mankinds fall from glory in the garden of Eden was a catastrophic event of epic proportions, one of the great defining moments in human history.  It altered the course of humanity and redefined who we were at our core.  Before the Fall, we were sons and daughters in paradise; after the Fall, we were orphans and strangers in exile.  Our interpretation of that one event has shaped our self-identity.  And our interpretation of Gods words and actions in the midst of the event has shaped our perception of who he is and the nature of his heart toward us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Redefined&lt;/em&gt; chronicles a journey back to the time of the orphaning of the human heart.  It dares to reinterpret the story in the light of the smile of Abba God.  It offers the hope that if Adams darkest moment can be redefined, then our darkest moments can as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the ramifications are huge. For the life of Christ and his work on the cross will never look the same to us again.  And our excuses for remaining powerless against the enemy will be lost forever.&lt;/p&gt;" />
