  <title>Comforting Christ - Rev J. C. Washington</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book deals with the Messiah, the comforting Christ. By the leading of the Holy Spirit, I wrote my understanding of the comforting Christ. The comfort he gave to his disciples after explaining about his pending crucifixion and explaining and teaching about the one who will come after him. This finished product will help you to understand more about the Messiah, what his work was all about while on earth and the challenge his disciples faced when he was no longer with them. It will show the way to Christ and will point to a new way of life for us today as it did for his disciples after his death. It tells what his suffering meant then to those who gathers at the foot of his cross and what it means now to us who look back and marvel at what took place back then." />
