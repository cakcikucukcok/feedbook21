  <title>The Three Apologies of G.K. Chesterton - G.K. Chesterton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Gilbert Keith Chesterton has become synonymous with modern Christian apologetics.&amp;nbsp; But his impact goes beyond just those interested in a defense of Christian thought.&amp;nbsp; His writings have influenced such diverse authors as C.S. Lewis, Marshall McLuhan, and Jorge Luis Borges, and remains a subtle and unseen presence in contemporary Catholic thought.&amp;nbsp; At his funeral, Ronald Knox said &amp;ldquo;All of this generation has grown up under Chesterton&amp;rsquo;s influence so completely that we do not even know when we are thinking Chesterton.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp; Before his conversion from atheism to knowing God, C.S. Lewis, the author of &lt;em&gt;Mere Christianity&lt;/em&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;em&gt;The Great Divorce&lt;/em&gt;, said &amp;ldquo;in reading Chesterton, as in reading MacDonald, I did not know what I was letting myself in for. A young man who wishes to remain a sound atheist cannot be too careful of his reading. There are traps everywhere &amp;mdash;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chesterton wrote in a time when materialism and new forms of political theory were soon to cause havoc in the western world.&amp;nbsp; His was a voice calling for restraint - pointing back to the fundamentals of Christian doctrine, the purpose and value of which was being lost in the noise and commotion of the post industrial age.&amp;nbsp; Describing the rush towards less familiar and attractive ideologies, Chesterton wrote: &amp;ldquo;In the matter of reforming things, as distinct from deforming them, there is one plain and simple principle; a principle which will probably be called a paradox. There exists in such a case a certain institution or law; let us say, for the sake of simplicity, a fence or gate erected across a road. The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, &amp;lsquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t see the use of this; let us clear it away.&amp;rsquo; To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: &amp;lsquo;If you don&amp;rsquo;t see the use of it, I certainly won&amp;rsquo;t let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it.&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chesterton was a man who continually showed us the use of orthodoxy in Christianity - most of all in his three great apologies: &lt;em&gt;Heritics&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Orthodoxy&lt;/em&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;em&gt;The Everlasting Man&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Heretics&lt;/em&gt;, he first points to the flaws in the beliefs of the moderns.&amp;nbsp; In &lt;em&gt;Orthodoxy&lt;/em&gt;, he defends the values handed down through millennium of Christian dogma.&amp;nbsp; In &lt;em&gt;The Everlasting Man&lt;/em&gt;, he tells the grand story of Christianity itself and the often ignored miracle of its appearance in the life of man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chesterton was a great debater, often trading blows with modern thinkers such as George Bernard Shaw, H.G. Wells, Bertrand Russell and Clarence Darrow.&amp;nbsp; He became known as the &amp;ldquo;prince of paradox,&amp;rdquo; He was also a prolific writer, producing biographies on St. Augustine and St. Francis, and touched on many of the varieties of religion in his writings.&amp;nbsp; He wrote fiction as well, authoring the famous Father Brown books and the &lt;em&gt;Man Who Was Thursday&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chesterton was certainly not the imitation of Christ in his personal life.&amp;nbsp; A large man fond of food and drink, he was almost childlike in wonder of the magic of the world, while expressing the wit of an ancient.&amp;nbsp; He gave no secret doctrine or systematic theology, but his &amp;ldquo;goodness&amp;rdquo; and basic &amp;ldquo;common sense&amp;rdquo; led many to the Church.&amp;nbsp; One commenter stated: first you read C.S. Lewis, then Chesterton, then you become Catholic.&amp;nbsp; Despite his less than temperate life, he is now under investigation by the Church for Beatification: such was his impact.&lt;/p&gt;" />
