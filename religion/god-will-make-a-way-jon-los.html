  <title>God Will Make A Way - Jon Los</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Father of orphans, champion of widows, is God in His holy house. God makes homes for the homeless, leads prisoners to freedom, but leaves rebels to rot in hell. (Psalm 68:6 &amp;ndash; The Message)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a lonely, scary world for most. We didn&amp;rsquo;t choose to be here, yet, here we are. We face trials and tribulations all alone, or so it seems. We might have a sense that &amp;lsquo;someone&amp;rsquo; is watching over us, but that is cold comfort when we are being treated unfairly, especially by the ones we look to for love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book is about the journey from unwanted to adopted. It&amp;rsquo;s a true testimony of how God is with us even when we don&amp;rsquo;t know Him, or even acknowledge that He exists. If we don&amp;rsquo;t harden our hearts and become bitter, which I admit is a challenge, God will reveal Himself to us in His gentle ways. If we are completely honest with ourselves, we will admit there have been many times when we have been delivered from situations that otherwise would have harmed, or even killed us. He didn&amp;rsquo;t say life would be easy, but He did say He would be with us, even until the end of the age. My prayer is that you will be blessed and encouraged as you read this testimony.&lt;br /&gt;
