  <title>Through Minds’ Eyes - Ryan J. Hite</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a book of history, ethics, and philosophy. It is a record of teachings passed down through the generations from the East and the West. It contains the fullness of the sealed covenant established between man and the laws of the universe. As we evolve as a race, we take things out of our lives because we better understand who we are and what we have achieved. The divine refers to the laws of nature and the universe that guide us in our everyday lives.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The creator that guides our everyday lives is not something that we should worship or pray to out of fear or love; it is something that remains unseen and works in natural forces to explain all the events that happen on Earth. It is merely a force and it is not necessary to belong to a group to experience the light. The path to the light is straight and broad. The creator of the universe is a divine and intellectual force, by which all things came into being.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The sealed covenant is a pact between all of humanity to the world around us and the universal laws that guide our everyday lives to come together and love one another and come to make the world a better place for all people. This shall usher in the evolution of religious traditions and humanity to a new age of prosperity." />
