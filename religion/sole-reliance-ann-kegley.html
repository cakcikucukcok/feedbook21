  <title>Sole Reliance - Ann Kegley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;We have the Holy Spirit who was sent from heaven to guide us, counsel us, encourage us, and teach us the truth of God so we are enabled to live according to Gods plan for man. As we grow in our faith, we eventually learn to become less dependent on human support. Not that having support from others is not beneficial, because it is. But there comes a time in the progression of our faith when God will draw us closer to Him. In fact, inevitably He will wean us from the necessity for external support and transition us toward a dependency on our internal support: Him. He has a covenant with us, and He is committed to the fulfillment of His covenant. As John stated, because His anointing abides in us, we have no need for anyone to teach us, because He will. We learn to live a life of sole reliance on Him.&lt;/p&gt;" />
