  <title>Waiting for Heaven - Heather Gillis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Life can sometimes lead us to unexpected places, to only leave us broken, desperate, and hurting. Heather Gillis and her husband, Mac, waited in anticipation for the birth of their third child. Like many Christian couples, their dreams and expectations in marriage, parenthood, and daily life developed differently than theyd planned, and left them grieving a life that would never be. Their journey gives insight into a new normal and uncovers the stepping stones of the healing process. In their process, they re-discovered Gods abounding love through their experiences of joy, heartbreak, and purpose. Heather reaches out to parents around the globe to speak openly about being a wife, mother, friend, relative, or stranger during life-changing trials and devastating struggles. In Gods love, she has found beauty in the midst of pain, as well as peace in His presence on Earth while waiting for heaven.&lt;/p&gt;" />
