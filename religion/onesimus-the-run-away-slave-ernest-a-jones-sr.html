  <title>Onesimus, the Run-Away Slave - Ernest A. Jones Sr</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div class=Section1&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;The main characters in this story
come from the Bible.&lt;span style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;I have taken a
little known man, &lt;span class=SpellE&gt;Omnesimus&lt;/span&gt;, and formed &lt;span
class=GramE&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; uplifting, high moral story.&lt;span
style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;He is only heard of in the &lt;span class=GramE&gt;new
testament&lt;/span&gt; books of Philemon and &lt;span class=SpellE&gt;Colossions&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span
style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;The Apostle Paul, who wrote &lt;span
class=GramE&gt;Philemon &lt;span style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;sent&lt;/span&gt; this
letter to Philemon to help him show mercy to this run-away slave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;This is a story that the young
will enjoy!&lt;span style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;It has excitement, drama and
love but without language that would offend anyone.&lt;span
style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;I have gleamed information from encyclopedias
and from the Internet concerning the area in which this story takes place,
gaining information about the climate, agriculture and terrain of the land,
trying to make the storys setting accurate while still folding a fictitious
story around the main character.&lt;span style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;I have
also talked to a person who has lived in the area my story takes place, and
gained information here too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;The first few pages start with &lt;span
class=SpellE&gt;Omnes&lt;/span&gt; childhood in what is now &lt;st1:country-region&gt;&lt;st1:place&gt;Turkey&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:country-region&gt;.&lt;span
style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Then as a strong, husky youth he is taken by
raiders.&lt;span style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;He is treated, harshly, as a
slave and for several &lt;span class=GramE&gt;months&lt;/span&gt; lives in the filthy camps
of those who stole him.&lt;span style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Here he is
befriended by another slave, a lad about his own age, who tells him about the
God in Heaven.&lt;span style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;This boy tells &lt;span
class=SpellE&gt;Omne&lt;/span&gt; that the gods of silver and wood are worthless!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;After many months &lt;span
class=SpellE&gt;Omne&lt;/span&gt; is taken away from this camp and sold as a slave to a
man who treats his slaves well.&lt;span style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;This man
had been visited by one of the men who help Paul and he believed in Christ
too!&lt;span style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;One day while &lt;span class=SpellE&gt;Omne&lt;/span&gt;
is working his team of oxen in a field near the river, he rescues his masters
young son from drowning.&lt;span style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;This feat he
did even though he had never learned to swim and this act nearly takes the life
of this helpful slave.&lt;span style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;As a reward for
the valiant act &lt;span class=SpellE&gt;Omne&lt;/span&gt; is given Martha, a most lovely
and sweet young lady, for his wife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;With the passing of time children
are born into this &lt;span class=GramE&gt;couples&lt;span style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;home&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=SpellE&gt;Omne&lt;/span&gt;
and his family are treated almost like children of the masters household.&lt;span
style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=SpellE&gt;Omne&lt;/span&gt; is respected
by his master and the other slaves whom he is now boss over.&lt;span
style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;All goes well until &lt;span class=SpellE&gt;Omnes&lt;/span&gt;
eldest son dies and &lt;span class=SpellE&gt;Omne&lt;/span&gt; cant accept his death.&lt;span
style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;He grows very despondent, and blames God for
his sons death.&lt;span style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Feeling that all hope
is gone he steals from his master and leaves his beloved wife and children.&lt;span
style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;He tries to run away from God but in the
process finds that God is ever with him even through 2 robberies and beatings
that nearly kill him while traveling clear to &lt;st1:City&gt;&lt;st1:place&gt;Rome&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;In &lt;st1:City&gt;&lt;st1:place&gt;Rome&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt;
he meets Paul, who along with Luke and several others applies soothing balm to
his battered body and coaxes life back into his body once again.&lt;span
style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;At last &lt;span class=SpellE&gt;Omne&lt;/span&gt; is
able to forget the past, accept his LORD again and full of hope and love
returns to his family and to his master.&lt;span style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;Paul wrote a letter and sent it with &lt;span class=SpellE&gt;Tychicus&lt;/span&gt;,
one of his trusted workers, to be given to &lt;span class=SpellE&gt;Omnes&lt;/span&gt;
master. The two men then return to &lt;span class=SpellE&gt;Omnes&lt;/span&gt;
master.&lt;span style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Though willing to forgive his
slave Philemon still puts him through 90 grueling days of hard labor before
once again taking him back as a trusted slave; but not really as a slave but as
a son!&lt;span style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;The freedom he has longed for so
much for so long is finally his! &lt;/p&gt;
