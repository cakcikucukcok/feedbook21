  <title>LOVING A BEAUTIFUL MIND - Carolyn T. Linn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Loving a Beautiful Mind is the story of a brilliant, talented man who while preparing for a promising career in academia was diagnosed with schizophrenia. Written by his wife of over forty years, the book tells the heart-wrenching story of the effect of mental illness on a marriage and family. The experience is told from the standpoint of an active faith in Jesus Christ, dedicated to living life with a mighty God who loves His children. The onset of schizophrenia for this couple predates the advent of organizations and support groups that now give education and assistance to families dealing with mental illness. The participants in this story relied only on a powerful God to answer their prayers and meet their needs. And God does not disappoint! The memoir includes an increasing awareness of brain diseases, progressing from stigma-filled superstition to scientific enlightenment and successful treatments. Modern pharmaceutical research and improved methods of managing schizophrenia enhanced the lives of this couple. Seen through the wife&amp;rsquo;s intimate viewpoint, the book follows her courageous journey through devastation, hope and finally resignation to her husband&amp;rsquo;s altered future. Be inspired by the faithfulness of a personal God Who works wonders in the life of both partners, bringing about the arrival of a New Love beyond all imagination! For the author, the reward that came from loving this beautiful mind was an illumined understanding and a revitalized faith in the God of all healing!&lt;/p&gt;" />
