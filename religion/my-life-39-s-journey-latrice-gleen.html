I read this book and I was hooked (couldn&#39;t put it down) right from the beginning! Latrice describes in great detail the real-life, emotional struggles of a young girl with ALOT of drama in her life. She also recounts the many hard lessons she learned and continues to learn as she matures. This book was very raw, honest, deep and extremely personal. I would highly recommend this book.

You are so precious to me, I am so happy that you are writing so that you can help others. Many of us really believe that the deeds done in this life is a secret, for some of us yes. In sharing you dreams, aspirations and stumbling blocks and some high walls that you sought strength to climb or knock down or remove stone by stone, has allowed you to be set free from the past, looking forward to the God adventures in this life, to attain eternal victory. Always Love" />
