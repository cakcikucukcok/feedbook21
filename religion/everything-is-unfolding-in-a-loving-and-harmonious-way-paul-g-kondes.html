  <title>Everything Is Unfolding in a Loving and Harmonious Way - Paul G. Kondes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;You will find herein a detailed description of the personal experiences of the author and his wife as they used spiritual law, ideas held in mind, produce after their kind, attracting blessings into their lives for more than fifty years and counting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus, the Master Teacher, expressed this spiritual law: As you believe, so shall it be done unto you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will get a complete picture of their manifesting adventures and the principles they followed in creating a life where everything unfolds in a loving and harmonious way! Most importantly, this is a story of their self-discovery and a guide to yours. It is not religious but very spiritual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is hard work the primary requirement for personal success and having the good things of life, or the progressive realization of a worthy ideal? Does what you think have more to do with success than what you do? Do religious beliefs stand in our way as we walk the path of life? Are there toxic people in your life who keep telling you that you cant have your dreams? Are you fully aware of your hidden talents?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These and other subjects will be discussed as you and the author go on a journey of discovery, empowerment, and enlightenment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on over fifty-five years of study and experience, the author makes observations into the effectiveness of the various religious and political structures that impact our lives and what one can do to maintain control of life in the face of the limitations placed on us by the powers that be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By books end, you will be given an understanding how to create a life where everything is unfolding in a loving and harmonious way.&lt;/p&gt;" />
