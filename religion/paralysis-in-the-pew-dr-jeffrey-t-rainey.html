  <title>Paralysis in the Pew - Dr. Jeffrey T. Rainey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The author admits that the church has the highest unemployment rates. The church has been gifted by the Lord with many vital ministries that are available for the growth of the body of Christ. Sadly, the greater percentage of members are neither enrolled nor engaged in the work of the ministry. As a result, very few members keep the local church functioning, while the majority of the members (because of what the author calls, functional paralysis) have neither feeling nor desire to function. Too many congregants are a part of the membership but apart from the ministry. Too many are unaware or uncaring concerning the needs of the body and of the bodys genuine need for them in order to effectively function. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the author describes as paralysis in the pew is a grave yet growing spiritual condition within the local churches. As a physical impediment, paralysis has been drastically improved, even cured, with the aid of physical therapy, prescribed treatments, and personal trust and initiative. It is the authors contention that parallel treatmentswhen viewed spiritually and applied in the spiritual and physical realmcan drastically improve, even cure, paralysis in the pew.&lt;/p&gt;" />
