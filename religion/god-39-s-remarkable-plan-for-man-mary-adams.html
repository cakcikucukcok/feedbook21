  <title>God&#39;s Remarkable Plan for Man - Mary Adams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Within the pages of this book you will find a two sided key, One side to open the prison doors to set the captive free, the other side to unlock and release our true identity. You will see how God is producing His remarkable plan to unravel the dilemma mans disobedience has gotten him into.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This book reveals the origin of how man came into the complexity of his being. Mans duality of good and evil keeps him in constant confusion and conflict, as he tries to juggle the fruit from the forbidden tree in his effort to understand the complexity of his being. There is no unity in the Tree of knowledge of good and evil, it does not contain, nor can it ever yield life-producing fruit.  Its foundation, based on a lie from the beginning, produces confusion and conflict, and its fruit is death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no duality, confusion or conflict in the Tree of Life. Its foundation is rooted and grounded in unity and truth and its fruit is life. Our God is not complicated; Hear O Israel, the Lord our God is one (Deut. 6:4). As a flower blooms and its wonders unfold, may our souls unfurl with truth revealed and blossom with understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will find this book to contain an explosion of truth, expounding on the true work and function of the Holy Spirit among us. This book is a must read for every Christian and should be in the hands of every seminary student as well as professors and theologians.&lt;br /&gt;
