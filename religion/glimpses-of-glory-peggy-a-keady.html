  <title>Glimpses of Glory - Peggy A. Keady</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Glimpses of Glory looks around the corners and peeks into the hidden places in life, places where deep spiritual truths reside but remain unseen. By sharing poems and prose that speak winsomely and insightfully of lifes realities, Peggy A. Keady offers a collection of Christmas Letters and Faith Notes that foster in its readers a desire to explore the themes of a rich life: beginnings, changes, companionship, new life, time, and trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps because of her varied experiences working as an educator and counselor in public schools, churches, hospitals, and nursing-care facilities, the author found she was attuned to how the glimpses of glory she spotted in one place could be made visible to people in other places. As a result, she turned a series of annual Christmas letters and a run of monthly newsletter articles into Glimpses of Glory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you yearn to learn more about how spiritual power can pervade and enrich your life, then you will find in Glimpses of Glory a guide for uncovering often overlooked spiritual truths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An uplifting compilation of inspirational vignettes sure to calm 
the troubled spirit and renew faith in the eternity of the soul.&lt;/p&gt;
