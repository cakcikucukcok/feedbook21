  <title>Dangling - Amy Carr</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Are you or someone you love facing a diagnosis of cancer? Perhaps you are coping with a chronic illness or facing one of the biggest disappointments of your life. Have you ever wondered how such a trial could change your life for the better? Let Amy show you how God used her cancer journey to teach her life-changing lessons that she otherwise would not have learned. From the darkest of days leading up to her diagnosis through eighteen months of treatment and surgeries, she shares it all. You will be inspired by her resolve to walk by faith, not by sight. This book is filled with nourishment for your soul, hope for your heart, and encouragement to live life to the fullest, with true joy, regardless of your circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full of truth, transparency, authenticity, and Scripture, Dangling is a must read for anyone going through lifes difficulties. I loved the book, but I loved watching Amy live out her faithfulness to Jesus more. The lessons she learned through her journey with cancer are real lessons for everyone to learn and live by. As Amy says, God wants what is best for us, not what is easiest.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark McKeehan, pastor of Chilhowee Hills Baptist Church&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amy Carr lives out the fact that God is absolutely sovereign and her cancer is not. In the whirlwind of chaos that cancer can cause, Amy knows that she can rest (dangle) in His sovereign grace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniel Ibach MD, oncologist&lt;/p&gt;" />
