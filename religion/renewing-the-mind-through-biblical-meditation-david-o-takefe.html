  <title>Renewing the Mind Through Biblical Meditation - David O. Takefe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="THE Christian journey is not vague or directionless; there is a specific end in view. That end is Christ. Gods ultimate purpose for the believer is conformity to the image of Christ. All the Father is seeking to accomplish in the New Creation is to make us like His Son. This lofty goal of our Christian faith is what the Scripture speaks of as coming to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.
After a man gets saved, he must begin a journey of transformation into Christ-likeness. Unfortunately, this is not often explained and taught sufficiently to those who come to our Lord Jesus Christ. Consequently, many have sadly forgotten that the only evidence of the new birth is the new life.
In this book, you will not only discover the goal of Christianity, you will also discover the practical steps to a successful Christian life." />
