  <title>Ink Matters - Leslie D. Cooper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Christians should have an audacity of faith with an auspicious outlook on life; but instead, we forget to keep our focus in perspective. We all struggle with inadvertent, day to day living and unruly heart interruptions. This, of course, is all along the lines of lifes journey. However in Christ, getting an understanding of our concrete problems becomes water under the bridge. How you perceive your problem will shape and determine your outcome. Your problem can either be deemed as a tool to catapult you into your victory or your spiritual death announcement upon your defeat.  Its your call!   
	Hidden in the writings of these poetic expressions and emotional odysseys, are minor, yet, helpful tips. One can be mindful that he or she is not alone, and during our struggles they should not be endured alone. We must understand that we need each other no matter what heartache or pains befall us! We need to grasp an understanding of the greatest gift which is LOVE and allow it to flourish throughout our natural being. Once we allow love to rule in our hearts we can expect an increase of happiness in our lives. We must reach our destination by any means necessary! We must be willing to TRULY demonstrate the power AND character of our father by developing in wisdom and maturing in the anointing of love, so that we may reach our destination, as well as successfully  accomplish our God given tasks!" />
