  <title>The Promise Keeper - Kathleen Ford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Society has changed dramatically during the past thirty years. We are witnessing the breakdown of the traditional family, the rapid erosion of basic morality and the slaughter of unborn children through abortion on demand.  Education has been hijacked and history is being rewritten. 
Whereas the children of earlier generations grew up with the knowledge of the Bible and Christian principles through the State education system, this avenue has been methodically closed by government with the vigorous assistance of humanist and atheistic teachers unions. As a result most people have a minimal, even nonexistent knowledge of God and his wishes for man.
The Bible is Gods Word to man, and Ive taken a very brief walk in scripture to distil the essence so that the reader learns of Gods infinite love and salvation but is also encouraged to read the Bible and learn more." />
