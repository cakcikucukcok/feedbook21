  <title>Leviticus 1–27 for All People: a Reminder Book–Remember - Maryland J. Harrison</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is a reminder book from the Holy Bible, both Old and New Testament conformation. This idea came to me from God, and this is the way I was lead to do the book to get people back to reading the BibleGods Worda little at a time. People need to see and know how serious sin is, for sin is dangerous. Jesus Christ came and gave His life for sin, so that we can repent and be saved and live without sin and know what sin will do for us and where sin will send us. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sin will take you where you dont really want to go. Sin will make you stay longer than you really wanted to stay. Sin will make you pay more than you really wanted to pay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wage of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ the Lord. To let the people know how serious sin is, it doesnt matter who you are or how much money you may have. If you are living in sin and die, you will spend eternal life in Hell to be cast into the lake of fire. This life is temporary, but our life after death is eternal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where will you spend your eternal life?&lt;/p&gt;" />
