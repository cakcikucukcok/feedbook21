  <title>From the Natural to the Supernatural - Danielle DeMartino</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Miracles, healings, raising of the dead, salvations and more true testimonials are found in this book of God&#39;s power, still at work today. Matthew 10:8 says, Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out demons. Freely you have received, freely give. Ephesians 4:1112 says, And He himself gave some to be apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some pastors and teachers for the equipping of the saints for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ. &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God has given each one of us a calling that includes supernatural gifts. Be encouraged in your gifts as you read the true stories of a natural woman and others attaining the supernatural in Christ.&lt;p&gt;
This book will truly change your perception of Gods ability to work
the supernatural in you and through you! This timeless compilation
of stories takes you on an amazing adventure of signs, wonders, and
miracles communicated through many personal experiences. Not only
has it compelled me to draw closer to God, but it has encouraged me to
let God do the supernatural through me while relating to me on a very
personal level!

From the Natural to the Supernatural is a must-read, a true gem! It thrusts
you on an adventure into the realm of the Supernatural like you have
never experienced before. This book inspires you to close the door on the
mundane Christian life and explode full force without seat belts into the
supernatural realm of Gods power, protection and provision.
