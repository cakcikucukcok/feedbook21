  <title>The Buck Stops Here - Claudia Harris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The body is dead! 
The Church Can Be Resurrected 
And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? Again he said unto me, Prophesy upon these bones, and Say unto them, O ye dry bones, hear the word of the Lord. 
The church has been given the power. If change comes about in our nation, it will not come from the White House, where many are trying to go. Politics and religion do not mix. Healing for our nation will come when we individually and collectively as a body of born-again believers take a peaceful stand for righteousness. Zechariah 4:6 says, Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the Lord of hosts. We, individually and collectively, have the power of changethe power to enlighten and change the mind-sets of those who have been taught wrong and those who are doing wrong. We can point people in a more positive direction. We are all connected, so if the nation goes down, we all go down together. 
Collectively and individually, we have a great work ahead of us. We have lost a generation of youth. This is not the time for division. We are all connected. Thus said the Lord God unto these bones; Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you and ye shall live  So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold a shaking, and the bones came together, bone to his bone (Ezekiel 37:57)." />
