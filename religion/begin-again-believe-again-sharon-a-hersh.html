  <title>Begin Again, Believe Again - Sharon A. Hersh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Our hearts as women were made by God for relationships. Why is it, then, that the thing we most deeply desire—relationships—becomes the source of so much pain? Difficult marriages, the loneliness of being single, problem children, abusive employers, fractured friendships...life&#39;s realities are often very different from the dreams we dreamed for ourselves as girls. How do we live with this beautiful ache for relationships in a world that doesn&#39;t always work?When we&#39;ve been betrayed, how do we trust again? When we&#39;ve been disappointed, how do we hope again? When we&#39;ve been terribly hurt, how do we love again?In this honest, intimate, and transformative book, counselor Sharon Hersh helps you gain a new, truly biblical perspective on relationships that can help you endure the heartaches and still come up living wholeheartedly, loving with abandon, and daring to hope and believe. The stories of the women in this book, including that of the author, are signposts that point you beyond the sometimes devastating problems of life to the deep, rich reason and root of all relationships, both good and bad: God&#39;s desire for relationship with you.In Sharon&#39;s words, “Relationships are not the destination—they are the path to something more.”" />
