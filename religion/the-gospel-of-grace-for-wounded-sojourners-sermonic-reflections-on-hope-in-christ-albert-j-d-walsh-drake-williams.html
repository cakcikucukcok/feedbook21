  <title>The Gospel of Grace for Wounded Sojourners: Sermonic Reflections on Hope in Christ - Albert J. D. Walsh, Drake Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this collection of sermons, Dr. Albert Walsh, after more than three decades of pastoral ministry, presents the gospel message as the Christ-centered proclamation of hope for all those who sojourn along the path of life. Walsh&#39;s sermons speak directly to those who hold faith in Christ, but they also speak with force to those who are searching for the meaning and purpose of life as the gift of a gracious God. This collection of sermons offers the reader a word of genuine hope in times of trial, struggle, and in the face of the innumerable sufferings--both small and great--we so often experience in life. These sermons cover the whole of the life of Christ from his incarnation to his death, resurrection, ascension, and promised return in glory to offer spiritual enrichment for all." />
