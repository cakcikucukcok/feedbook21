  <title>Why Believe It? - John Huffman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book provides necessary answers and evidence for the faith. It is important that believers should be ready to give an answer to anyone who would question the Christian faith. This book provides information and facts based on history, science, and scripture to defend the faith once delivered to the saints. With this information, believers will be better able to stand strongly for the orthodox Christian faith.
This book is about clarifying many misconceptions about the book of Revelation and about the unbounded love and grace of God toward his superior creation of mankind. It discusses such issues as what has been called the unpardonable sin, whether Christians are under any part of the law, and how to view prophecy.
It explains the necessity for believing in God as the Creator of the heavens and the earth and of all life on this planet. If you have not understood the Virgin Birth, this book explains from Scripture and biology how Jesus was both human and divine without violating any physical laws. It explains that God the Father made Jesus the Son above all things for a time to be human as well as divine that he might live the perfect life and die as one totally innocent of any sins so that he would be able to provide the perfect sacrifice for the sins of the world. Once his mission is fulfilled, scripture says he will be made subject to the Father and God will be all in all. This book brings a number of biblical subjects together in short concise chapters that can be easily read and understood." />
