  <title>Creative Wisdom - Dr. Jasmine Inc. Renner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Have you ever said something that was so profoundly insightful that you knew, without a shadow of a doubt, that a deeper wisdom than yours was speaking? In fact, there are times when someone else does the same thing and deep inside you are certain that the fountain of that wisdom did not originate in the person speaking. Have you ever done something that was so profoundly unique that you knew, without a shadow of a doubt, that a deeper creativity than yours was manifesting itself through you?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the past some have tended to emphasize creativity at the expense of wisdom or vice versa. I propose that these two invaluable gifts are to a large extent indistinguishable and inseparable, and although there are important differences between them they remain a strong, undefeatable powerful force when put together. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Creative Wisdom you will discover that there is a profound connection between creativity and wisdom. In fact most creatives who are known for lasting inventions and innovation operate in wisdom in one way or the other. This book is also a valuable tool to help you uncover, discover, stimulate and grow creativity insights through the instrumentality of wisdom. This book transcends from simply putting out information and techniques about creative wisdom to putting into the hands of all who are desirous a 365 daily wisdom and creativity declarations and notions that will literally affect the way you perceive and think." />
