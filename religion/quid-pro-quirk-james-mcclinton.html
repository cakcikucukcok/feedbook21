  <title>Quid Pro Quirk - James McClinton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Have you ever read a Bible passage that seemed to contradict other Scriptures, or simply didnt make sense? Have you ever wanted to answer a skeptic who insisted the Bible was full of errors, but didnt know how to respond? Do you hesitate to share your faith because you dont know what you believeor why you believe it? Quid Pro Quirk seeks to resolve such issues and help you share the reason for the hope that is within you (1 Peter 3:15).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a legal context, the Latin phrase quid pro quo means to exchange something for something, or this for that. &lt;em&gt;Quid Pro Quirk&lt;/em&gt; uses a courtroom setting to exchange plausible explanations for alleged Bible quirks. The compelling explanations can give you confidence as you add to your knowledge and understanding of Gods Word.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Quid Pro Quirk&lt;/em&gt;, the prosecution begins with an opening statement establishing the background behind each alleged quirk and then finishes with a specific charge. The defense responds, using the Bible and other sources to dispute the charge. After considering all of the evidence, you act as judge and jury in rendering an informed verdict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quid Pro Quirk&lt;/em&gt;s explanations are as brief and concise as possible, and yet remain faithful to the letter and spirit of Gods Word in responding to a broad spectrum of charges. A handy reference source for the layman that avoids dry and endless rhetoric, Quid Pro Quirk focuses on the key facts that can bless you in your quest for Gods truth.&lt;/p&gt;" />
