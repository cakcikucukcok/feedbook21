  <title>The Deferment of Hope - Marc D. Simon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;I approached The Deferment of Hope with high expectations and did not come away disappointed. Minister Marc Simon writes from a deep and compassionate space within himself. His intimate journals strategically placed throughout the book tell the story of a life lived on the run, and in confinement, both in and out of the penitentiary. Once you begin reading you will immediately recognize that Marc was not serving time, but time was serving Marc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bishop Kalem Kengga&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zoe Ministries of the Antelope Valley&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is nothing in our own time which the enemy fears more than a thinking church. For a fired up and emotionalized church, which nonetheless refuses to think, is no real threat to the stronghold of ignorance which persists in our communities, despite much fervency in our worship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marc D. Simon&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Deferment of Hope&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join the author in a penetrating look into the mind and thoughts of a prisoner in exile. Experience the deferment of hope, and the lessons learned along the way. Simon, through his provocative narrative and teaching, challenges us to rethink our ideas about hope, all the while weaving the reader through the inspiring story of his own 12 year incarceration in prison, loss, and his journey of faith and redemption. The Deferment of Hope resists traditional religious boxes and modes of speech, and ushers the reader into the authors own interior world of experience.&lt;/p&gt;" />
