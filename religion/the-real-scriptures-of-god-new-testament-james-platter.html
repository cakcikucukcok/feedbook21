  <title>‘The Real Scriptures’ of God – New Testament - James Platter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Inside the covers of this book you will find the Real Scriptures of the Christian churches. Many church leaders know that other Christian churches hold to these books but they are only willing to state what they have been brain-washed to believe, that is about the other inferior books: It isnt in the canon (of scripture) formed of course by the early Catholic Church at various stages and Councils from the fourth century A.D. therefore no one has the right to change what is in the canon of scripture and the Catholic Church changed it in their councils not in agreement of other Christians but to hide their offence at the words of God. They would not even imagine that different churches have different scriptures and assume that the correct canon of scripture must be the one first declared by the Catholic Church
and its priests but other priests must be considered demented or apostate, but they are not affected by the changes they made to the canon of Scripture over many centuries. They will not consider the canons of Orthodox Churches or others because they vary in different regions of the world. So is European Christianity based in the Vatican City right about all its holy scriptures while everyone elses church scriptures are false scriptures? Ethiopia it seems got most books of scripture right even with their translation into an ancient language!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The Real Scriptures, edited by James Platter above, a layman who formerly studied the scriptures for many years with the Baptist Bible Fellowship in San Dimas, California in the United States, but now rejects the reduced 1627 A.D. Version of the KJV Bible, and formally learned the Greek language of the New Testament at Capernwray Missionary Fellowship, Moss Vale, N. S. W. Australia under the Reverend
Alan Catchpoole in 1973." />
