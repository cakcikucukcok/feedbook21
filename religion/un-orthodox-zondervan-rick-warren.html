  <title>Un.orthodox - Zondervan, Rick Warren</title>
      <meta name="description" content="From its roots in the South Bronx over thirty years ago, hip-hop has swept across continents and oceans, shaping the music and mores of urban culture. It is more than just music. Hip-hop is a lifestyle that encompasses attitude, fashion, and a largely counter-Christian worldview. Transcending ethnic, geographic, generational, and economic barriers, hip-hop places one of the church’s biggest mission opportunities right outside our windows.Un.orthodox equips church leaders and parents alike to understand and engage a culture that is as near as our schools, our communities, and even our homes. Author Tommy Kyllonen has seen hip-hop from the inside as a recording artist, as well as through the eyes of a pastor whose congregation has set the model for a groundswell of young urban churches focusing on hip-hop culture. Offering unique perspectives on the history, current state, and future of the hip-hop movement, Kyllonen shows what a hip-hop targeted ministry can look like in worship, outreach, evangelism, service, and discipleship.Using his own story as an example, Tommy shows how you can combine the hip-hop culture with faith." />
