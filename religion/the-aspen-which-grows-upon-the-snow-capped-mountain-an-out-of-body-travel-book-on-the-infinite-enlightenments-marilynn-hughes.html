      <meta name="description" content="THE ASPEN: Which Grows Upon the Snow-Capped Mountain - An Out-of-Body Travel Book on the Infinite Enlightenments - Death as Progression in Out-of-Body Travel and Mysticism demonstrated by the continuing cyclic exchange between birth and death and the born and the unborn.   The final journey can also be one of many out-of-body journeys  embarked upon in this human life.   After all, It is said that aspen trees cannot grow on the icy mountain peak, because it is stone and the air is so thin . . . so the multitude of aspens (like the multitude of people) grow below the altitude line where the air is thicker and the ground softer (and the training easier).  But it is only the icy snow capped mountain peak of successful training, although it be made of the stone which continually remains unresponsive to the defiling passions, which allows for the tree to grow upon its rocky face." />
