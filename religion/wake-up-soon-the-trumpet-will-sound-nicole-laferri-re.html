  <title>Wake up Soon!  the Trumpet Will Sound! - Nicole Laferrière</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The reason for this book is to share with you Nicoles thirty-five years of Christianity in the hopes that it will help you in your walk with Jesus.
During 20132014, while she was fishing, the Lord gave her the concept of this book. She wrote all what came to her spirit. Today, she wants to share this with you and to encourage and comfort you. 
When Jesus gave us His treasure, it was not to hide it but to share it with others so that they can be blessed as well. Nicole was awakened at 3:00 a.m. to write a song. Since French is her mother tongue, she is very fluent in her native language. But the Lord gave her the song in English to make sure that he knew it was from Him. The next day, He gave her the music to play on her guitar. Today, that song is on YouTube to bless whoever listens to it. It is entitled Wake Up Soon by Nicole Laferrire. She has also included that song in this book." />
