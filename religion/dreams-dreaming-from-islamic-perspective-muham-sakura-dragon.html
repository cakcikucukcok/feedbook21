  <title>Dreams &amp; Dreaming from Islamic Perspective - Muham Sakura Dragon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Merriam Webster online Dictionary defines a dream as a series of thoughts, images, or emotions occurring during sleep. Dreams and musing over their meanings and interpretations enrich our lives. Dreams put us in touch with our deepest emotions; they enchant us and frighten us; they contain our most secret wishes and fears.  Islam says that dreams can be meaningful but the scholars have warned that not all dreams should be considered as such.  Renowned Islamic scholar Ibn Sirin, an expert on dream interpretation mentions in his classical book on the subject that dream interpretation is a difficult science and that scholars treat it with the upmost care.  Prophet Muhammad taught us about dreams, also with the upmost care, and he mentions dreams and dreaming often.  It is from Prophet Muhammad that we learn that dreams are of three types, known in Arabic as, Rahmani (from God), Nafsani (from the self) and Shaytani (from Satan)." />
