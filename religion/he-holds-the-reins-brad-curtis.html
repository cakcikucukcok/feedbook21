  <title>He Holds the Reins - Brad Curtis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As a pastor of Mountain Top Cowboy Church I have discovered that there is little material designed specifically for cowboy churches or cowboy ministries. Although I have been in the ministry for 16 years I had never considered writing a book however the Lord had other plans. In October of 2009 I broke my leg while competing at a 40 and over bull riding which required surgery. I do not believe that it was Gods plan for me to ride a bull at the age of 46 but my books are an example that the Lord will use every situation we are in for good if we will allow Him to use us. During my time of recovery I started writing poems and short stories about my rodeo days then it turned to cowboy poetry. In the beginning it was a way to pass the time and deal with my situation. As I continued to write I began to relate my poems to scripture and it was then that the Lord truly began to use them to reach others. After sharing a few with my church I discovered that they could be a useful tool in cowboy churches and ministries or those in the western culture. My first book of poems and proverbs On The Trail was just another example of the Lords Grace and Mercy in my life. He Holds The Reins is a continuation of that Grace and Mercy. Now that I am On The Trail with Christ I allow Him to take the reins of my life while I ride toward heaven on the narrow trail.&lt;/p&gt;" />
