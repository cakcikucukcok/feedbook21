  <title>He Loves Me! - Cedrick Brown, Lisa Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="He Loves Me! by Cedrick Brown vigorously wrestles with the underlying
question within ones heart: Does God really love me?
Over the years, I have encountered countless people who do not feel loved
by their parents, their spouses, their children, or anyone at all. This unloved
feeling, I have also witnessed, possesses the power to cause them to ponder
the seemingly never-ending question: Does God love me? Like them, I too
have wrestled with this frustrating question, which eventually manifested
itself in many tangible ways that those closest to me found themselves
engulfed by its fl ames.
Maybe the side eff ects of this age-old question have tipped your life scale in
the wrong direction, and those around you are feeling its eff ectsunloved
by you.
Like petals falling from a fl ower, we all grapple on the inside with this
unavoidable question: Does God love me? We still pluck each imaginary
petal, with each emotional stroke, saying . . .
He loves me,
He loves me not,
He loves me." />
