  <title>Wake up Christians! - Ivory J. Sanders</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;I&gt;&lt;P&gt;Wake Up, Christians &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;/I&gt;&lt;P&gt;Written by the inspiration, respect and love of God.  The idea for this writing came one day as five missionaries were in route to the hospital in their visitation ministry to the sick.  To read the Bible and to minister in the laying on of hands with prayer for healing through the Holy Spirit of God. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;As they went, they began to discuss various topics of interest, including the following: &lt;/P&gt;
Satan goes to church 
In bondage to nervousness - soul problems 
Curses put on people 
Angels of God and Satan&#39;s angels 
&lt;P&gt;This inspired one of the missionary ladies to write the book - and thus the pages began to take form. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;We build our worship on the truth revealed in the Word of GOD. Christian worship must be tied to the Word and Spirit of God. The Word of God is the anchor; the Holy Spirit is the guide. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;The purpose of this book is to awaken Christians and tell sinners about the devil&#39;s wishes to enslave men through his power. There are three sources of power common to human understanding. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;a. Divine power that comes through the Holy Spirit. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;b. Satanic power which comes from the Devil. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;c. Human power or manpower which can be directed by heavenly or demonic powers. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;After reading this book you should have a better understanding about GOD&#39;S power and plan to save our souls and the devil&#39;s plan to destroy our souls. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;God is love and peace. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The devil is torment and hell.&lt;/P&gt;" />
