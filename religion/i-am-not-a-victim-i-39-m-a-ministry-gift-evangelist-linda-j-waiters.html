  <title>I Am Not a Victim, I&#39;m a Ministry Gift - Evangelist Linda J. Waiters</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book, a testimony of the author&#39;s  life experiences permitted by God, is simply God&#39;s predestined release of just one of many tools specifically designed to awaken His Church from its state of apostasy.  As the author unveils Satan&#39;s strategic plan to abort her God ordained destiny to preach, the fundamentals of apostasy which not only worked against her but continue to work against the true Church of today are also revealed. Evangelist Waiters meticulously contrasts the activation of spiritual gifts, such as dreams of Hell in her childhood, versus satanical attacks like molestation, racial struggles, voodoo, betrayals, addictions, promiscuity, and abortion designed to destroy her even before she received Christ and recognized the call on her life.  God delivered her from the jaws of death several times.  After receiving Christ and being gloriously baptized in the Holy Ghost, she records experiences in church which promoted Satan&#39;s plan of destruction more so than God&#39;s plan of redemption.  She shares events which ultimately led her back into cycles of destruction including internet dating.  Nevertheless, her testimony serves as God&#39;s heart cry and warning to clergy worldwide against the mishandling of His children seeking Him as their refuge.  Eventually, God&#39;s grace brings her to the realization that she is not the vessel of dishonor she resigned herself to be, but that she was systematically being trained and qualified to sound an alarm to the Body of Christ.  Consequently, this book exposes the workings of the spirit of Jezebel which operates hand-in-hand with apostasy.   Satanic snares and contracts are exposed, along with explanations as to why Believers remain bound and ineffective, through the discussion of false prophets, greed, tradition and idolatry.  The author concludes by extending hope to readers through the discussion of salvation and why we need Jesus Christ to save us.
