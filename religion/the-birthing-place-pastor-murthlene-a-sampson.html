  <title>The Birthing Place - Pastor Murthlene A. Sampson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The birthing place shows how God sends complete breakthrough to a nation when all their hope was dried up. It concentrates closely on the three prophecies mentioned in Ezekiel 37 and explains that through the obedience of one prophet a nation received change. It also demonstrates that your gift is developed and/or multiplies when you are facing the most difficult challenges in your life.
At the end of each chapter refl ection questions are given to help individuals to understand the level that God has for them and the direction that has been mapped out for their lives in the kingdom of God. You will understand that your valley experience causes pain but this pain will allow you to fi nd out what your gift(s) is in the kingdom of God. You will also be able to understand how to know when God is speaking to you and how to separate yourself when God is calling you to ministry." />
