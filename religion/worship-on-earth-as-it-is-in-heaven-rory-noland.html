  <title>Worship on Earth as It Is in Heaven - Rory Noland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Rory Noland addresses the challenges of Christian worship head-on, offering practical suggestions gleaned from Scripture on understanding and experiencing vibrant worship. The first half of Worship on Earth as It Is in Heaven explores what it means to grow as a private worshiper. The practices of the psalmist David provide insight to help people worship God on their own. Second, Noland discusses corporate worship by exploring the glorious gatherings in heaven, as described in the book of Revelation. He presents immediately applicable ideas for becoming a better corporate worshiper. This book includes: • Slice-of-church-life scenarios. Every chapter begins with a brief scenario that presents a worship-related issue or a conflict corresponding to the chapter topic. • Group discussion questions. Based on the opening scenario, these questions help readers think about and discuss worship-related topics from different perspectives. • Issue-by-issue practical guidance from a biblical perspective. • “Ponder and Apply” application questions. Each chapter ends with a series of discussion questions and action steps to help readers identify key insights and make personal applications.&lt;/P&gt;" />
