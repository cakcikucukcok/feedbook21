      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Jim Ackley had been unemployed for nearly two years. During that time, the Lord was tugging at Jim&#39;s heart to do something that would help people come to know him. As he tried to grasp exactly what he was supposed to do, there were different incidents that guided his decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Influenced by a newborn baby, a friend&#39;s daughter who needed help, and a niece who re-entered his life after being out of sight for twenty-five years, Jim finally realized that the Lord wanted him to write &lt;em&gt;Footprints into Your Faith.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

There very likely is a subject in this book that you will identify with or sympathize with. Each chapter has Scriptures that are the basis for the subject.&lt;/p&gt;" />
