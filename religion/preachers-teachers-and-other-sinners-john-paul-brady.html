  <title>Preachers, Teachers and Other Sinners - John Paul Brady</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;God gives each of us stories to tell. He teaches us life lessons through our everyday experiences. We have opportunities to take the lessons we have learned and share them with others to bring glory to God while encouraging our listeners to draw closer to Him. The telling about what God has taught us is our story. This book is a compilation of stories and devotions gleaned from the authors experiences as a middle school teacher, a preacher, and unfortunately, a sinner. In his unique voice the author has blended scripture with his stories to reveal the lessons God taught him. These experiences are not uncommon to any Christian who encounters people everyday and has children, grandchildren, or a spouse. Almost everyone will be able to relate to the stories in this book. Many of the selections will make you laugh while others are touching and heartwarming and will possibly bring a few tears. Preachers, Teachers and Other Sinners is an entertaining book. Of course not everyone is a preacher or a teacher, but all of us sin occasionally. This book was written with the purpose of directing the reader to a loving Savior who desires to draw all people to God no matter who they are.&lt;/p&gt;" />
