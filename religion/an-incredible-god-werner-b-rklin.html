  <title>An Incredible God - Werner B端rklin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;An Incredible God: China and Her Encounter with God balances the immense scope of any treatment of a country as varied in geography and as diverse in its ethnicities as is China with the intimate portraits that emerge from profiling individuals who face and surmount obstacles to living by faith. The Reverend Dr. Werner Brklin, born in China to German Christian missionary parents, who has served as a missionary, draws upon personal insights and his years of study to accomplish this balancing act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Incredible God introduces the reader to China, pulling back the veil on its culture and character and illuminating both the history of the Christian church and its work to spread the good news of Jesus Christ. Along the way, An Incredible God covers topics like the interactions of Christianity and Communism, the role of theological education, the importance of the Scriptures, and the prevalence of misconceptions about China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the intimate and personal side, An Incredible God presents people like Wang Mingdao, who survived imprisonment for his faith during the Cultural Revolution. The presentations place the individuals in their historical context and show how their faith sustained them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Incredible God: China and Her Encounter with God speaks to all who desire to know more about the history of the Christian church in China, to understand more about the faith of individual Christians, and to gain a deeper appreciation for the amazing changes God causes when he encounters people with the good news of Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;" />
