  <title>Who Do I Tell? - Marcella Vasquez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There is an amusement park in Washington, DC, called Great Adventures, and thats what I call my journey with the Lord. I have had many trials but many more victories. The enemy of our souls will try to destroy us, but we must remember that the enemy has already been defeated at Calvary. God keeps us in the palm of his hand (Isaiah 49:16), and he has promised to never leave us or forsake us (Deuteronomy 31:6). Man did not want to acknowledge the things that God used me to do, but I did what I was called to doand you can too. With God, all things are possible (Matthew 19:26). God has used me to heal the sick, raise the dead, and see the blind receive sight, but I didnt know that these things were going to be part of what he called me to do. As I came to know him more, things became clearer. God has a plan for my life. 
By now, you must realize that God is knocking on the door to your heart. He calls to us, but we must be obedient to respond. We are all on a journey from birth to death, and sometimes, it can be uphill. But thanks to the grace of God, we have victory through our Lord Jesus Christ (1 Corinthians 15:57). 
I wrote this book to share the reality of God with you. Even when you were a child, God had his hand on you whether you realize it or not (2 Timothy 2:19). If you are broken, he wants to piece you back together. If you are in tears, he wants to wipe them away. If you are wounded, he wants to heal your wounds. He so longs for us to experience his goodness and his faithfulness. The divine encounters that Ive experienced have happened over several years, but the more that hes given me, the more that I want. To me, it is so exciting to see God in action." />
