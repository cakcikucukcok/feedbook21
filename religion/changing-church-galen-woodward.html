  <title>Changing Church - Galen Woodward</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;Galen describes in detail the experiences that are rarely talked about in the life of a seasoned Pastor... This book is a great read for Pastors, teams and church members. When I opened the manuscript on this book I was immediately drawn in. I felt like I had front seats in the life of a great pastor&#39;s incredible journey...&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Kevin Gerald, senior pastor, Champions Centre&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;My father, who is a veteran of two foreign wars, told me he did not want to be led into battle by any man that had never been shot at... From legalism, to religiosity to genuine miracle... This is a guy I&#39;m willing to listen to.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Dr. Mark Rutland, President of Global Servants&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;...As I read this book, I was motivated, stirred and challenged. Get your copy, read with intent, and be prepared to be inspired!&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Dr. Dave Martin, author of The 12 Traits of the Greats&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;...Changing Church will inspire you to reach beyond what you see today and into the God-Inspired dream that he had placed into your heart.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
J. Don George, founding pastor, Calvary Church, Irving, Texas&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Watching one of the fastest growing churches in America is so much fun, but what did it take to get there? ...This literary piece of genius shows us the behind the scenes of leadership...&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Shannon O&#39;dell, senior pastor, Brand New Church&lt;/p&gt;
Discovering that dreams really do come true
Step by step approach to church growth
Breaking attendance barriers
The power of narrowed focus
The value in embracing change" />
