  <title>40 Days in His Presence - Beverly Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What could be better than partnering with someone who can give us the how-tos of life in this modern age? What if this person had all the remedies to the modern ills of society, and what if this person could be the voice of wisdom we need to silence the maelstrom of noises vying for our attention? Thankfully, we can keep company with our omnipotent God, who is just the person we need to guide us. &lt;p&gt;
In &lt;i&gt;40 Days in His Presence&lt;/i&gt;, author Beverly Williams invites all who are genuinely interested in capturing the wisdom of God to spend time with him daily in prayer, thanksgiving, and reflection. In a society full of quick fixes, we can instead find the real solution to lifes everyday challenges in the holy words of our consummate counselor, God. &lt;p&gt;
Gods Word, the Bible, can equip you to face and conquer those little foxes with confidence as you go about your day. And although social media and even your peers will tell you that anything goes in this day and age, only the timeless wisdom of God and his direction will give you the peace of mind, joy, and fulfilment that you seek. &lt;p&gt;
I am excited to write this for Beverlys first book, a powerful devotional that I know will bless readers and help them grow in maturity and power as they walk with the Lord. &lt;br&gt;
