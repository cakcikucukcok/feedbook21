  <title>A Long Climb up to the Bottom - Rob Ray Taylor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There is an ongoing battle between good and evil. The first battle was in the bible when Lucifer attempted to overthrow God and become a god himself. This resulted in him being banished from heaven along with one-third of the angels. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    Bring this event up to modern times and you have the story in this book. Dr. Allman, a gifted chemist and scientist and a righteous man, develops a serum that improves the mind and moral fiber of mankind and seeks to distribute it. He has a jealous employee named Lyle, who is a graduate of MIT, and also gifted in science. Lyle&#39;s goal is to overthrow Dr. Allman and take control of his laboratory in the World Trade Center during the 1970&#39;s. He accomplishes this by tainting the serum to cast a shadow of incompetence on Dr. Allman and his staff.  His plan works and he becomes the President of Infinity Laboratories only to be fired when his diabolical plan is uncovered. Lyle and his ex-porn star wife sets about to start up their own lab and they join the Satanist Church. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    Fast-forward to 2001 when Lyle and Polly&#39;s world collapses on September 11. Next, go with Lyle through a literal hell and go with his nemesis, Emmanuel (Dr. Allman&#39;s son) in heaven. Be with them when they both are returned to earth for a final confrontation." />
