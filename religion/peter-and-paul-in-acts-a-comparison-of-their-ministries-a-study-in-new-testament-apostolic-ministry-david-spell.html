  <title>Peter and Paul in Acts: A Comparison of Their Ministries: A Study in New Testament Apostolic Ministry - David Spell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Acts is arguably the most exciting book in the New Testament. It covers the tumultuous early years of Christianity and narrates the growth of the church throughout the Roman Empire. Luke tells this story by focusing primarily on two men, Peter and Paul. This book examines their apostolic ministries as they are revealed within the pages of The Acts of the Apostles.   Their apostolic ministries are examined in the context of several different components: Leadership, Evangelism and Church Planting, Miracle Working and Healing, and Mystical or Supernatural Experiences. These categories are shown to detail particular aspects of each man&#39;s apostleship work. These categories provide a convenient way to compare and contrast the type of ministry that each apostle performed, as described by Luke.  Spell also devotes a chapter each to Luke&#39;s literary method and the relationship of Peter and Paul as seen in their letters. These two chapters lay important groundwork for examining the apostles. This book will provide the reader with valuable insights from Scripture that they can apply to their own lives and ministry. By looking at how Peter and Paul conducted their ministries in the first century, we can be more effective in the twenty-first." />
