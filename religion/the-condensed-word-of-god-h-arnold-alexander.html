  <title>The Condensed Word of God - H. Arnold Alexander</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Condensed Word of God offers succinct summaries of the Bibles bookschapter by chapter. These straightforwardly worded paragraphs, grouped by biblical book and numbered by chapter, give the reader a clear sense of each chapter in the Bible. These summaries can substitute for a sustained reading of the Bible or they can provide insights for one to use as guides for Bible reading. The one exception to this approach is Revelation. As the Introduction notes, Revelation 22:19 pronounces a judgment: If anyone takes words away from this book of prophecy, God will take away from him his share in the tree of life and in the holy city. For this reason, The Condensed Word of God suggests reading this biblical book from ones chosen translation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summaries naturally are shorter than their sources and set aside some of the sources details. Even so, The Condensed Word of God gives a clear sense of each chapters main points. This is clear when one compares the widely beloved Psalm 23 with the summary in The Condensed Word of God: The Lord is my shepherd, and he takes care of me. He comforts me from death and from my enemies, and I shall dwell with him forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether one desires a companion for ones study of the full text of the Bible or one seeks an approachable distillation of the Bibles main themes, The Condensed Word of God will meet ones expectations, providing easy access to the Bibles nearly innumerable high points.&lt;/p&gt;" />
