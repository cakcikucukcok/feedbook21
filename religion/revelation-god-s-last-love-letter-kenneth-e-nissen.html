  <title>Revelation: God’S Last Love Letter - Kenneth E. Nissen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Revelation is addressed to the churches in chapter one and for the churches in the last chapter. One would expect Gods last love letter to be a favorite book among Christians, but it isnt. It isnt because it isnt understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book has been highly received by numerous evangelical leaders and is used as the textbook on Revelation in Bible colleges as far away as Africa and India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the first, I was taken with the desire of Ken to help people see that the book of Revelation was written primarily to help people in their walk with God in the midst of troubled times, and not as a text to figure out the sequence of the end times. This was also the first time I had seen the theme of overcoming given as the main thrust of Revelation. So, I had to read his manuscript to see if in fact he had come upon something I had missed. I am convinced that he has. I have found his book to be extremely helpful to see the desire of God to have his children to be overcomers, and the resources available to us to do just that as the end approaches. And the book is more than that, for it does not side-step the questions that are raised as one reads the book of Revelation. Stephen R. Bradley, Director of Field Education, Columbia Bible College. Columbia, South Carolina&lt;/p&gt;" />
