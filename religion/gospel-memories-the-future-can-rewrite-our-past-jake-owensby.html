  <title>Gospel Memories: The Future Can Rewrite Our Past - Jake Owensby</title>
      <meta name="description" content="• A &quot;new&quot; (2012) bishop in the Episcopal Church offers hope that healing and all things are possible • A reflective and prayerful education and formation resource for adults  While there is truth in the idea that our past shapes our future, the gospel is all about the counter-intuitive promise that God is shaping us right now toward God&#39;s vision of who we will become. It is not our past that makes us into the image of God; God&#39;s redeeming love does that. In God, who we are not yet is shaping who we become.   Appealing to anyone drawn to a deeper understanding of their own story and a richer sense of God&#39;s transforming presence, this book will have special resonance for people at turning points in their lives. Career changes, loss of a loved one, graduation, illness, divorce, birth of a child, entering middle or later years: Life is filled with turning points at which we feel compelled to tell our story in a new and different way. Each chapter focuses on a gospel passage, leading to a reflection on a significant point in the author&#39;s life which uncovers deeper and more personal meaning in the biblical text. Questions conclude each chapter, engaging readers to look at their own lives - good and bad - and find God, experiencing the joy, surprise, and healing of God&#39;s future rewriting the past.  Audience:  Clergy, spiritual directors, individuals (spiritual seekers, those in discernment, bible reflections); adult study; pastoral care: those seeking hope and healing from a troubled past." />
