  <title>To God’S Glory - Faye M. Thompson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A collection of God inspired poems, written about events in my life. Some written about family and friends, some are words the Lord has given me, or dreams I have had. I believe my poems can help people that are hurting from life&#39;s trials. Furthermore, much of what I have written is revelation from our Lord that I have received personally. Friends say that my poems make them think about how they are responding to different life situations. Some really get ministered to by reading my work. My poetry touches peoples hearts where they need to be healed, they can relate. God reveals answers to life if we will only listen." />
