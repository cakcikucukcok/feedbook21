  <title>It’S Ok to Say the Name of Jesus - Gloria Ector</title>
      <meta name="description" content="On the pages in this book, my hope is that you experience the enduring love and encouragement of God and the ultimate gift of himself through his Son, Jesus Christ. Through each inspirational story accompanied by supportive scriptures, I hope that youll be inspired and encourage by the daily devotional journal. Through the writing of this book, Ive come to see with clarity the awesomeness of the God we serve and his ability and willingness to nurture, protect, and deliver us through and out of any situation we may experience in our life. The Lord is a call away, and his ears are not too heavy that he cannot hear you. The calls he answered in the days of old, he still answers today. The Lord so beautifully said in Isaiah 41:17, When the poor and needy seek water, and there is none, and their tongue faileth for thirst, I the Lord will hear them, I the God of Israel will not forsake them. In writing this book, my faith has been renewed, my strength has been strengthened, and my relationship with him has been restored. We have an inheritance from God, and Jesus has gladly paid the cost for our inheritance. As you travel through each page of this book and revisit the living portrait of his splendor, glory, and the inheritance that he left to us, we now know that it is OK to say the name of Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
And therefore will the LORD wait, that He may be gracious unto you, and therefore will He be exalted, that He may have mercy upon you: for the LORD is a GOD of judgement: blessed are all they that wait for Him. (Isaiah 30:18; KJV)" />
