  <title>Consider What the Angels Say - George DeVangelos</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Our world now and throughout history has had conflicting accounts of the nature of God and man&#39;s relationship to this cosmic deity. These conflicts have wrecked havoc within the societies of humanity to dangerous levels. Mankind has relied upon his sacred and canonized scriptures to provide doctrinal absolutes for his religions, but these absolutes differ and therefore cannot possibly all be correct, at least in specific contexts. However, there exist a very mysterious book circulating worldwide that does have specific, detailed, and consistent answers to all of our questions. The origin of this book is steeped in mystery and no human author has claimed ownership to its teachings which cover 2097 pages of intensive reading and exhaustive information. This book is known as the Urantia Book and has been placed in the public domain. The Urantia Book takes us from the conceptual locations within our segregated religious heritage and correctively re-calibrates our various belief systems which have been unavoidably limited and distorted by our world-views throughout human history. After its conceptual enhancements and adjustments, the Urantia Book enlarges such informational details into an elevation of more exact universal levels of perception as an advancement of cosmic truth. &quot;Consider What the Angels Say&quot; takes this expansive and intricately complicated book and presents a timesaving presentation of its teachings and gently correlates it with Christian doctrines and other religions as well as human philosophy and knowledge. In this book, the following questions will be answered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What exactly is God and how does this phenomenon relate to infinite reality, the time and space cosmos, other spiritual beings, and our world?
Exactly what is the Godhead Trinity and why is it a necessary foundation for the existence of universal  reality?
What are angels and spiritual principalities? What are their levels and types, and how do they interface and interact between supernatural and human situations?
How does the historical Jesus Christ fit into the spiritual dimensions of reality. How is he related to the one eternal God and how is Jesus an integral part of our soul salvation?
How was man physically created and what accounts for the variances in human biological races and how does this correlate with the theory of evolution?
What is the nature of the human soul and how is it translated into the eternal spiritual realities and how does it exist beyond death and what is its destiny?
How did mankind come to develop and organize his  cultures and what part did supernatural spiritual beings play in the formulations of man&#39;s religious doctrines?
Why has there been so much tragedy, hardship, war, disease, and social discord throughout our history? What is the nature of sin and why does evil even exist. Something is not right, what went wrong?
&lt;p&gt;In all of the versions of religious theologies and doctrines worldwide, no one book explains the details of these universal mysteries as completely and systematically as the Urantia Book, it is truly a gift from the angels. Consider What the Angels Say is a concentrated effort forged from the heartfelt love and concern for humanity to introduce this majestic angelic book to all who are able to receive and benefit form its supernatural information.&lt;/p&gt;" />
