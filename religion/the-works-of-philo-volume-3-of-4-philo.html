  <title>The Works of Philo (Volume 3 of 4) - Philo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Philo, known also as Philo of Alexandria, Philo Judaeus, and Philo the Jew, among other names, was a Hellenistic Jewish philosopher who lived in Alexandria from 20 BC to 50 CE. Philo&#39;s works are most known for being allegorical interpretations of the Scriptures, fusing Jewish thought to Stoic philosophy. Although not widely accepted in his time, his vast collection of works had a powerful influence on early Christian theology and especially on later Christian writers like Clement of Alexandria, Origen, Saint Jerome and Athenagorus. Despite being a devout Jew, some saw in Philo a cryptic Christian. This is the third of four volumes of &quot;The Works of Philo,&quot; and contains many of his cosmogenic, historical and political works like &quot;On the Life of Moses,&quot; &quot;On Monarchy,&quot; &quot;On Justice,&quot; &quot;On Rewards and Punishments,&quot; and &quot;To Prove that Every Man who is Virtuous is Also Free.&quot;" />
