  <title>Dark Night of the Soul - Saint John of the Cross</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Written in the 16th century by a reform-minded Carmelite monk, &quot;Dark Night of the Soul&quot; is a treatise focusing on the metaphor of a dark night to represent a lonely phase in one&#39;s personal spiritual life. Saint John was a Roman Catholic mystic and a Spanish poet, and this work reflects his mystical stages toward union with God. Divided into two books, the purification of the senses and the spirit, &quot;Dark Night&quot; describes these two phases and additionally explains the ten steps of the ladder of love, which was first expressed by Saint Thomas Aquinas. In Saint John&#39;s poem, one comes to understand his belief in a benevolent God, outside of all thought or imagination, who we can only come to know through love. A profound description of absolution, desolation, progress, and love, &quot;Dark Night of the Soul&quot; is a powerful poem that captures the discouragement of doubting yet believing Christians, even as it offers help through spiritual loneliness." />
