  <title>Unraveled, Time to Tell - Lisa Lynn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Unraveled, Time to Tell is about a life of secrets turned into heart-opening revelations from God and how a questionable death can change life and leave a young girl vulnerable and unwanted. This change leads to many consequences and puts in front of her choices she was unaware of and ashamed of. This girl lived her married life concealing these secrets, even from her own children.
This memoir tells us how her life of abusive, undesired, and unexpected actions could be replaced with joy, peace, and encouragement from God through His Word and His revelations. It includes help from Gods Word that will be an inspiration to anyone who reads it.
Her now-grown children heard for the first time her lifes details through this bookher letter to them. Their responses included wow, shocking, incredible to have survived, and a testimony of Gods redemption.
Other comments included:
A true inspiration, I could have never walked in my moms shoes.
A positive woman that never let the negative get to her.
Its a truthful tale of one girl going through life seemingly by herself, striving to survive and revealing those experiences through her own writing of her personal life.
Beginning with Chapter 1, The Darkest Day, you will read of her details and decisions, and hear the descriptions of how God revealed each meaning along with Biblical truths throughout. After all the unraveling, all she was shown, she now has to share.
