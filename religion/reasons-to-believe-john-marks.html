  <title>Reasons to Believe - John Marks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From a veteran journalist and former &lt;em&gt;60 Minute&lt;/em&gt;s producer comes an intimate portrait of evangelicals, one of the most influential forces in America today, and the story of how this lapsed believer came to terms with his faith. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;In 2003, while on assignment for &lt;em&gt;60 Minutes&lt;/em&gt;, I interviewed a couple for a piece on the Left Behind series, the bestselling Christian novels about the apocalypse. At the end of that meeting, they asked me a question: would I be left behind? In other words, had I accepted Jesus as my savior or would I go to hell? This book represents the answer to that question.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Born again at age sixteen, John Marks later abandoned his faith. In &lt;em&gt;Reasons to Believe&lt;/em&gt; he attempts to cross a deep cultural barrier to understand those who now condemn his way of life. He grapples with the message that millions of evangelicals attempt to deliver to their fellow citizens every day and speaks at length with missionaries, political activists, theologians, Christian musicians, and filmmakers&amp;#8212;the rich and powerful, the poor and broken, and the pastors who have turned small congregations into megachurches. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is familiar and often comforting territory for Marks, and he still has a profound understanding of what it means to be an evangelical. In &lt;em&gt;Reasons to Believe&lt;/em&gt; he presents this world from the inside out.&lt;/p&gt;" />
