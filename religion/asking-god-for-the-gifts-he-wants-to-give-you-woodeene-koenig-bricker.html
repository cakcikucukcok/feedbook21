  <title>Asking God for the Gifts He Wants to Give You - Woodeene Koenig-Bricker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As Christians, we believe that God always answers our prayers, but we don’t always get the answers we want. Popular Catholic author Woodeene Koenig-Bricker has discovered a prayer that asks God for gifts that he wants to give us--and our Lord’s answers will delight us! The prayer, written by the beloved seventeenth-century St. Alphonsus Liguori, asks God for five graces: forgiveness; wisdom; a share in divine love; confidence in the merits of Jesus and the intercession of Mary; and perseverance. Koenig-Bricker expands our understanding of each of these graces, explaining their meaning with teaching and Scripture and providing illustrations of their power with personal testimony and stories. &lt;br&gt; • A book that will inspire both beginners and those experienced at prayer.&lt;br&gt; • A conversation starter for Catholics involved in the New Evangelization.&lt;br&gt; • An ideal gift for any occasion." />
