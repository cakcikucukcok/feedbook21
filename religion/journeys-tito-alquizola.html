  <title>Journeys - Tito Alquizola</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, it only takes the actions of a few to make a positive impact on many. For Filipino native Tito Alquizola and his friends, it began in 1989 with a desire to pray with each other. What started as a small group of Filipino emigrants and friends meeting in a humble home soon turned into something much bigger than anyone could have imagined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Journeys tells the story of how a small prayer group became a large, Catholic devotional organization for the Santo Nio (Child Jesus), a countrywide devotion in the Philippines. Alquizola shares the history of the statue of the Santo Nio, which started in the late sixteenth century in the Philippines. This image has become a sense of home for Filipinos around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, Alquiziola shares the personal stories of emigrants who, in their search for home, not only founded an organization, but also created a devotional family. Their dedication led to the opening of the Santo Nio Shrine at St. Paul Church in Tampa, Florida, and created peace and hope for many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An inspiring tale of faith and commitment, Journeys seeks to speak to your heart.&lt;/p&gt;" />
