  <title>How Then Shall We Live?: Christian Engagement with Contemporary Issues - Samuel Wells</title>
      <meta name="description" content="• Reflections deal with issues that matter • Author is a renowned preacher, broadcaster, and internationally known ethicist  Essays by a preeminent Anglican figure on the salient issues of our time, &quot;issues on which I believe the Church should have a view,&quot; says Wells. The issues run the gamut from social, political, personal, life-cycle to theological. Some of the issues treated include Islam, migration, the rise of religious extremism, dementia, Israel, marriage, LGBTQ identity, domestic violence, death, shame, old age, retirement, assisted dying, ecology, obesity, inequality, Brexit, and the Trump presidential election.  &quot;Sam Wells arguably has the liveliest, most agile, best informed, critically disciplined mind in the entire Christian community; and he has a baptized heart of honesty, compassion, and passion to match his baptized mind. In this book he ranges over a cluster of complex issues, all the way from hard public questions of economics and politics to the most pathos-filed personal issues of retirement, dementia, and death. Concerning every issue, Sam&#39;s sound judgment instructs us as he moves easily from life to Scripture and back through church tradition. This book will serve many of us well who live with daily perplexities that admit no resolution.&quot; -Walter Brueggemann, Columbia Theological Seminary" />
