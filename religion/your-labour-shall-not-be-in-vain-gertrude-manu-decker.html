  <title>YOUR LABOUR SHALL NOT BE IN VAIN - Gertrude Manu Decker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;1 Corinthians 15:58 Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord. This is an exhortation, and is threefoldL( 1) That they should be steadfast, fixed in the faith of the gospel.&amp;rdquo; Do not let your belief of these truths be shaken. They are most certain, and of the most importance.&amp;rdquo; Christians should be steadfast believers of this great article of the resurrection of the dead. A disbelief of a future life will open a way to all manner of licentiousness. It will be easy and natural to infer hence that we may live like beasts, and eat and drink, for tomorrow we die. (2) He exhorts them to be immovable in their expectation of being raised incorruptible and immortal. Christians should not be moved away from this hope of the gospel (col. 1:23). This hope should be an anchor to their souls, firm and sure, Heb.6:19, (3) He exhorts them to abound in the work of the Lord, and that always. What vigour and resolutions, what constancy and patience, should those hopes inspire! They have the best ground in the world to build upon. As surely as Christ is risen, they shall rise. The labour of Christians will not just be lost labour; they may lose for God, but they will lose nothing by Him. He will never be found unjust to forget their labour of love. Nay, he will do exceedingly abundantly above what they can now ask or think. Those who serve God have good wages; they cannot do too much nor suffer too much for so good a master. If they serve him now, they shall see Him hereafter; they shall rise again from the dead, be crowned with glory, honour, and immortality, and inherit eternal life&lt;/p&gt;" />
