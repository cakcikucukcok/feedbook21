  <title>First Love Prayers - Bethany Frazer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The first title for this book was called My Prayer to My Love. It has always been a book from me to God and from Him back to me. &lt;br&gt;
It was 1999, I was away at Bible College in Sydney, Australia and God started giving me beautiful prayers and asking me to write them down and re-read them over to myself after I was done. When I would re-read the prayers I found I was weeping every time. He was expressing to me, through my own writing, how much He loved me. So much! &lt;br&gt;
It was then that He started leading me to put the prayers together in a book and to share the prayers with others. I gave them to only a handful of people, and watched as God started blessing their own prayer walks through these prayers. I realized that the prayers He was giving me were not sole for my benefit, growth and encouragement, but were meant for far more than just me. &lt;br&gt;
I feel honored that I am now able, 10 years later, to share these prayers with you. I pray they minister to you during different seasons of your walk and relationship with Him. And that they help you to grow closer and more intimate with Him, as you seek Him and His presence for every facet of your life. He really does love youso much!" />
