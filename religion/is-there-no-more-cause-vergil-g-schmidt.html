  <title>Is There No More Cause? - Vergil G. Schmidt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Since the beginning of the church, Christians have always struggled with culture and how best to relate to our world.  We are all familiar with the adage,  . . . in the world but not of the world.  We are aware that the Scripture requires us to be Salt and light as well as not to be conformed to the image of this world.  But the problem is that many of us have our blinders on and consequently we are unable to make a determination of whether we are in or of the world.  Inside the church where we strive to be holy and pure, the contamination of the world has become so pronounced that certain questionable activities and attitudes prevail.  Therefore, life becomes very confusing.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;So what is a Christian to do?  Some drop out, others ignore or refuse to heed the call to righteous living, while still others make up their own rules as they continue to live out their days.  However, there always is a remnant of Christians who take the Bible and Christian living seriously enough to return to the basics of Christianity and then earnestly attempt to transform our culture for Christ.&lt;/p&gt;" />
