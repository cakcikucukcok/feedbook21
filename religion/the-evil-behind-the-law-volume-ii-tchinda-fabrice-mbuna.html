  <title>The Evil Behind the Law Volume Ii - TCHINDA FABRICE MBUNA</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Miss Asunder has just won the DV Lottery in Cameroon, Africa to come to America, and has forged a marriage certificate with Mr. Fabrice at the American Embassy Cameroon Yaound to enter America. With the passage of time, Miss Asunder who has never loved Mr. Fabrice begins to fall in love with him for his fame as a poet, playwright and dramatist in Harlem, New York City.
Miss Asunder who is a Cameroonian like Mr. Fabrice finds herself in love against her wish and will, but her only flaw is she tries to use the feminist law as a woman in America to override the authority of Mr. Fabrice. Yes, a woman is always right, and with the feminist law, every woman can kill and redeem a man at will, she believes. She fails to understand that to be on your right does not always mean to be right, but to be on your right sometimes means to be wrong.
Mr. Fabrice later falls in love with Miss Saily, who being a Cameroonian has leant not to be more American than the Americans, because of the feminist law. On his wedding day with Miss Saily, there is a theological argument that broke out in church between Mr. Fabrice and Miss Clara, Sailys mother, and so she opposes to marry her daughter to a heretic.
Miss Saily cannot withstand seeing her bridegroom being tried for a heretic on their wedding day, and so she collapses, and sooner, Mr. Fabrice also collapse by his bride as both are rushed to the Harlem Central Hospital New York. Suspense, conflict, love, theological controversies, deception, theme of faith and fate" />
