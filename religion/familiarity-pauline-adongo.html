  <title>Familiarity? - Pauline Adongo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Familiarity is a commonplace in the church today, this book is very helpful in understanding how detrimental it can be to spiritual growth, individually, and even corporately. I am blessed beyond words by every chapter and content of this book. It is a must read for any Christian worker or leader who really value growth, continuity, and relevance in the kingdom of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pastor Denis Odhiambo Okang, MA, LPCC&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senior Pastor, LifeSpring International Church, Pennsylvania&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Familiarity is a distraction that robes us from experiencing the fullness in God and in life. When we become familiar with the things and the ways of God, we miss out on the more He would want to do in, with and for us. The main objectives for this book are to help you identify the subtle distraction of familiarity that can hinder your spiritual and natural growth; and to help you attain fullness and maximization of your potential in God and in life. Flexibility, humility, adaptability and obedience are key ingredients for spiritual and personal development. God does more when we are flexible.&lt;/p&gt;" />
