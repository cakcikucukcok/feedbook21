  <title>Servant Leadership: Leading with Unselfish Authority - James Tarter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Jesus introduced the idea of servant leadership and showed us how to do it. God requires leaders in His Kingdom to lead in this way so that every one of His children can have his or her true needs met.  This is true on earth, but a shortage of servant leadership works against the total fulfillment of His loving design for mankind.  This will be fulfilled far better in the great eternity that He provides His children.  He works to prepare His children now for our life in eternity by teaching our hearts to love, lead, and relate to each other like He does.  The Bible shows God&#39;s calling for servant leadership in His Church and in the family. We can also see its application to local and national governments wherever the Gospel has impacted these governments enough to change them from their natural way to do things.  This book shows how the Bible clearly shows all of the above conclusions." />
