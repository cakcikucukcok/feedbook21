  <title>Yours are the Hands of Christ - James C. Howell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Take spirituality into the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus didn&#39;t &quot;become flesh&quot; so we could &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; different. He came to this world so we will &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often our spirituality seems invisible and mute to a hurting world. Many of us simply internalize faith out of fear, feelings of inadequacy, or choice. A faithful response to discipleship&#39;s call, however, is both inward and outward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through Howell&#39;s study, you&#39;ll find ways to apply faith to your daily life and make evident your commitment to Christ. By considering all that Jesus did with his hands as a teacher, a healer, and a compassionate servant, Howell challenges readers to be the hands and feet and love of Christ in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Christianity must become something real, tangible, something that pervades all that we are,&quot; writes Howell. &quot;It must become something we do. In our culture, for Christianity to have any meaningful future, we must get serious about a genuine lifestyle that is holy without being elitist, engaged with the world without being jaded or self-righteous, active and busy yet prepared to cope with failure.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Howell&#39;s inspiration for this work comes from a poetic meditation written by Teresa of Avila, a Spanish nun who lived in the 16th century. The poem begins:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin:2px 20px;&quot;&gt;&quot;Christ has no body now on earth but yours, no hands but yours, no feet but yours.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Howell connects these words with the apostle Paul, who wrote in 1 Corinthians 12: &quot;Now you are the body of Christ.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Express your faith through action. Be the hands of Christ today to a hurting world.&lt;/p&gt;" />
