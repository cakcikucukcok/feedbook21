  <title>Satan: The Defeated Foe - Kenneth B. Alexander Bsl, Jd, Deacon, Sherry Mobley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In subsequent pages we will learn much about Satan: his ways, how he works deception on the whole world, his role as the accuser, his vicious, murderous nature, his role as God&amp;#39;s servant, his power, his weaknesses, and his drive to survive even after he has been condemned to eternal suffering by God in his own created pit of hell. Although Satan has been limited by God in what he can and cannot do we must not forget that he is very real and very dangerous to both the believer in Christ and to all inhabitants of the earth. After Christ&amp;#39;s resurrection, Satan became a defeated foe and his outcome made certain (see Revelation 20:1-10). However to this day he rages in anger seeking who he may devour. 1 Peter 5:5 says: &amp;quot;Be of sober spirit, be on the alert. Your adversary, the devil, prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour&amp;quot;. Satan is not the enemy of God he is the enemy of man&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some think that Satan was inert during the years comprising the Old Testament and only made his appearance fully known at the time of Christ. Nothing could be further from the truth. Satan was at work from the inception of the matters recorded in the Old Testament. He was at work in every nation on the earth from the beginning. Every nation that worshipped pagan gods and was at odds with Israel was ruled/inspired by Satan. This began with the Sumerians (the first civilization) to Babylon, Egypt, Chaldea, Philistines, Persians, Greeks/Macedonians, Rome, The Roman Church, to name just a few. John wrote in the First Century a verse of scripture that could easily be applied throughout history: &amp;quot;Who is the liar but  the one who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This is the antichrist, the one who denies the Father and the Son. Whoever denies the Son does not have the Father;&amp;quot; (1 John 2:22-23). Since the entire Old Testament wrote of Christ this scripture applies both to the New and Old Testaments. Christ said to the religious leaders of the day: &amp;quot;&amp;quot;You search the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; it is these that testify about Me; and you are unwilling to come to Me so that you may have life&amp;quot; (John 5:39-40). The entire Old Testament was written about Christ the Savior and Messiah who was to do away with sin and would banish Satan forever. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are two scriptures in the Bible which clearly define Satan. In Isaiah 14:12-17, which began as a taunt against the King of Babylon, he speaks of Satan showing the close tie between Babylon and Satan. He starts the taunt referring directly to the King of Babylon then mid-way through he changes and begins speaking of Satan directly. By doing this he is not distinguishing one from the other showing that God saw Babylon and Satan as one in the same (a subject that will be discussed in detail below). Isaiah speaks prophetically of Satan: &amp;quot;You have been cut down to the earth, You who have weakened the nations! &amp;quot;But you said in your heart, &amp;#39;I will ascend to heaven; I will  raise my throne above the stars of God &amp;quot;How you have fallen from heaven, O star of the morning, [Heb Helel; i.e. shining one] son of the dawn!, [Dan 5:22, 23; 8:10; 2 Thess 2:4] And I will sit on the mount of assembly In the recesses of the north. &amp;#39;I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will make myself LIKE THE MOST HIGH.&amp;#39; &amp;quot;Nevertheless [says God] you will be thrust down to Sheol, To the recesses of the pit. &amp;quot;Those who see you will gaze at you, They will ponder over you, saying, &amp;#39;Is this the man who made the earth tremble, Who shook kingdoms, Who made the world like a  wilderness And overthrew its cities, Who did not allow his prisoners to go home?&amp;quot; (Is 14:12-17).  In the end Satan is shown to be no more than a man." />
