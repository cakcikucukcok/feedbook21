  <title>You Should Know This - Elsie E. Strzyzowska</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As you walk among people in every hierarchical and demographic circle it is unavoidable. People are experiencing and feeling within themselves a numbness and tiredness that they never felt before. They explain it as something indescribable but when they start chatting with each other, it begins to sound eerily similar. For example, a common statement people are saying nowadays is Wow! The months are flying by so fast! I feel like it was just weeks ago we were celebrating New Years Eve. Or, Oh my goodness! I feel so tired! And I sleep eight hours daily!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people are experiencing today a flood of inconceivable worries, fears, and disasters. I go many places and start a conversation with people and listen to their problems and emotions. The majority of people are suffering silently inside and trying to convince others that all is wellbut its not. To compound it further, theres extreme temptation of luring certain individuals into living a lifestyle that they simply cant afford. Hope is disintegratingvanishingand being manipulated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the Great Depression back in the days, people at least had hope in God. The excessive broadcasting of the end of the world theme in films during the past decade is intentional. Also, the battle between good and evil is intensifying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you should know is there are many people who are trying to get your attention. To divulge the truth&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you listening? Or too busy with what you think is important or entertainingbut in reality  is not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exploring the What Ifs questions Christians avoid talking about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is living in denial and darkness the best way to survive on this Earth?&lt;/p&gt;" />
