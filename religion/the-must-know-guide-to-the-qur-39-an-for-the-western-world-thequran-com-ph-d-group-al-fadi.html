  <title>The Must Know Guide to the Qur&#39;an for the Western World - TheQuran.com Ph.D. Group, Al Fadi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Qur&amp;#39;an: is it a book of terror or a book of peace? A divinely inspired text or a political agenda for jihad, sharia law, and global domination? How is one to know the truth about the Qur&amp;#39;an? Where does one even begin a personal study? With the growing global interest in Islam and the teachings of the Qur&amp;#39;an, Islam&amp;#39;s main source and foundation, the need to provide an objective tool to investigate the truth about Islam as a religion and way of life has become crucial. This scholarly work is a valuable beginner&amp;#39;s guide. Designed to provide readers with background information and address important issues raised in the Qur&amp;#39;an, it enables readers to better understand Islam and its impact on Muslim communities. The Must Know Guide to the Qur&amp;#39;an for the Western World is a modified version of The Qur&amp;#39;an Dilemma (Volume One), and contains most of Parts I and III of this earlier publication (2011). The content in both The Must Know Guide to the Qur&amp;#39;an for the Western World and The Qur&amp;#39;an Dilemma represent the effort and production of many former Muslim writers, Islamic specialists, scholars, editors, researchers, and translators. To non-Muslims who want to unravel the mysteries of Islam, this book presents information that Islamic resources rarely disclose&amp;mdash;to allow those seeking the truth to comprehend the full picture with all its outlines, colors, and dimensions. To Muslims who seek genuine choices far from the culture of &amp;quot;indoctrination,&amp;quot; this book opens a world of understanding to them, so that they can decide for themselves their intellectual and spiritual paths." />
