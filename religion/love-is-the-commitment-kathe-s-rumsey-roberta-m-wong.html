  <title>Love Is the Commitment - Kathe S. Rumsey, Roberta M. Wong</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In heaven, a glorious marriage awaits! Expectations mount. Excitement is everywhere. God has not spared even the tiniest of details. Everything is complete.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;As the church eagerly anticipates the return of her Bridegroom, Jesus Christ, thoughts of how to prepare for the royal celebration confront believers. What does one do to be ready for the eminent arrival of the King of kings?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Love Is the Commitment: Protocol Guidelines for Gods Royal Wedding&lt;/em&gt; contains specific keys for the bride-elect to get ready and to enrich her walk with the Holy Spirit. It includes time-tested testimonies to help Christians grow in faith and love in their personal relationships with God, family members, the church and others. The love the church has for Jesus Christ is the bond of unity that edifies His body on earth. If believers truly love Him, they will submit to His commandments and lay down their life for one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relationships can be the fulfillment of joy or, quite the contrary, a source of grave disappointment. By His example and wisdom, God teaches us how to build lasting relationships based on genuine love. This takes the willingness and actions of each person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As believers apply Gods kingdom principles in their daily interactions, they will witness their heavenly Fathers intervention. &lt;em&gt;Love Is the Commitment&lt;/em&gt; encourages others to live by faith in the Son of God as they prepare for their future role alongside the King of kings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For nearly thirty years, Kathe Rumsey and Roberta Wong have continued to meet for Bible study and intercessory prayer. They wish to share the fruit of this time with the body of Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honor to him: &lt;br /&gt;
for the marriage of the Lamb is come,&lt;br /&gt;
and His wife hath made herself ready&lt;br /&gt;.
--Revelation 19:7&lt;/p&gt;" />
