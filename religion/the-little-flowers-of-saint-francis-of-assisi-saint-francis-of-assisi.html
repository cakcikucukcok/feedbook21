      <meta name="description" content="Let us consider how the life of the glorious St Francis was conformed in every act with that of our Blessed Lord. For as Christ, before he began to preach, made choice of twelve Apostles, teaching them to despise all the things of this world, to follow him in poverty and in the practice of all other virtues, so St Francis, on the first founding of his Order, chose twelve companions, all lovers of poverty. St Francis tried to emulate the life of Christ in every aspect of his life and many believed that he succeeded. The story of St. Francis has inspired people for generations. Included are 53 stories of miracles and faith." />
