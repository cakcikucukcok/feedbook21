      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Can we trust a God who gives us different answers than we pray for? Who only fully reveals himself when we look back? Who lets us walk in darkness for months (and sometimes years) at a time? In &lt;EM&gt;Finding Faith in the Dark&lt;/EM&gt;, Laurie Short says yes, and through her story and the stories of others, she reveals a God who is able to transform the dark chapters of our lives into opportunities of grace.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Maybe you&#39;ve been there:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The husband or wife you stayed faithful to had an affair&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The death of a spouse or child has torn your heart&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;A diagnosis has taken away your health, your plans and your future&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;When these things happen, we are left wondering &lt;EM&gt;&quot;Where is that God who promises to answer our prayers if we trust in Him? Why isn’t my life turning out the way I hoped, let alone how I had planned?”&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If you are, or have ever been, in that place, this book is for you.
