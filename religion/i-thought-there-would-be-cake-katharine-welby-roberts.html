  <title>I Thought There Would Be Cake - Katharine Welby-Roberts</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;EVER THOUGHT LIFE ISN’T TURNING OUT QUITE AS YOU EXPECTED?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Growing up, Katharine Welby-Roberts imagined that being an adult was one big party. But depression, anxiety and crippling self-doubt led her to alienate herself from others. To replay events and encounters as nightmares. Occasionally, to be unable to leave the house.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aware of the cacophony of voices in her head, Katharine invites us to join her as she journeys to the depths of her soul. Here, with instinctive honesty and humour, she confronts the parts of her story that hinder her most.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As she charts a course that offers ways of coping with everyday issues, we are encouraged to embrace our own self-worth. To recognize the value of our existence. To let ourselves be loved. Exactly as we are.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;‘Brilliantly honest, often funny and wonderfully readable’&lt;br&gt;Martin Saunders, Youthscape&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;‘Wholly authentic in the face of suffering and struggle’&lt;br&gt;Will van der Hart, The Mind and Soul Foundation&lt;/p&gt;" />
