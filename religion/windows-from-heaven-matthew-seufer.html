  <title>Windows from Heaven - Matthew Seufer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Who could have known an afternoon walk around the block would eventually have such a profound impact on people around this world? Acts 2:17 says, In the last days, God says, I will pour my spirit out on all people. Your daughters will prophesy, your young men will see visions, your old men will dream dreams. It is all true! We are being shown His constant heart to reach His people through this remarkable photography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the greatness of the power would be from God and not from us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 Corinthians 4:7 (Aramaic Bible in plain English)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been an amateur photographer most of my life; the beauty in the world captures me. I had always been told my photographs were wonderful, and I knew I had a talent. Several years ago, my photographs began to change; suddenly they no longer represented my skill, they began to reflect the Creator behind the beauty. How blessed we are that God only needs an open heart! He reached out and touched me. He drew me into a remarkable journey to touch others for Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have spent the past several years on this very important and unique project. How could I have known that a walk around the block with my camera would find its way to so many people around the world that a snapshot from my lens would speak to hearts for God? How could I know how this path would change me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a proud native of Williamstown, West Virginia, a small town along the Ohio River. I enjoy the simple things in life and making a positive difference to those along my path. I now reside in Columbia, South Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;" />
