  <title>A New Identity Transformed by Truth - Phoebe Cruise</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;After accepting the Lord in her heart, Phoebe Cruise started to receive dreams, visions, and messages from Godbut didnt know what to do with these strange occurrences. Hungry for answers, she embarked on a spiritual quest, visiting one church after another. But what she found is what most people find when they attend various Christian churches: discrepancy. Within these discrepancies, Phoebe experienced a desire to seek Gods truth. As she opened the Scriptures and met one-on-one with her Father, His truth transformed her identity and empowered her to understand who she is in Christ. She understood for the first time Gods will and purpose for her life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phoebe chronicled her experiences with the Lord over a period of nine years, tracking her childlike faith as it grew into spiritual maturity and a full-blown mission to win souls for the kingdom. &lt;i&gt;A New Identity: Transformed by Truth &lt;/i&gt;was written so that you too might know and understand your true identity in Christ.&lt;/p&gt;" />
