  <title>Death of a Spouse - Erwin Parent</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Each Chapter has a Summary to share thoughts on various subjects. This allows me to discuss thoughts of suicide, moving on with your life and handling other matters such as honoring your loved one and consideration of family members. 
I had the pleasure of being in a writers group with author Erwin Parent during the winter and spring of 2015. Every month I was more than eager to read segments of his book, Death of a Spouse-My Journey. After my first go-around, I knew to always have a box of tissue on hand for each chapter that we were to review. Early morning sobbing was not unusual as I went through the pages. Poignant, sweet, heart wrenching, biblical, magical as well as a teaching tool for those going through sorrow, Erwins memoir touched something deep inside of me. His beautiful rhythmic, rhyming poetry as well as his simple, clear writing style somehow touches the reader on a very sweet and tender level. I fell in love with not only his two precious wives, but also the gentle man telling the story. Erwin Parent is a wonderful example that no one is ever too old to make a difference. A must read for everyone, because we all will go through similar times at some point of our journey.
