  <title>Comforts from the Cross - Elyse M. Fitzpatrick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Daily comforts from the gospel of Christ provide busy Christian women with brief but deep reminders of how his truths powerfully connect to their daily lives.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nothing comforts a woman&#39;s soul more than a fully understood and embraced gospel. But many women aren&#39;t finding solace in their relationship with Christ because they don&#39;t see how his life, death, and resurrection connect with soccer practices and swim lessons. Besides, they just don&#39;t have time to sit down and read a theology book, no matter how much they might hunger for God&#39;s truths.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That&#39;s where Elyse Fitzpatrick&#39;s latest book comes in. &lt;em&gt;Comforts from the Cross&lt;/em&gt; provides those well-intentioned women with bite-sized readings to remind them of their place in Christ and of his love and ministry in their busy lives. It also dusts off the facts of the gospel to show how ancient truths such as justification, sanctification, and redemption can free and enliven their souls every day. Even more, these five-minute celebrations of the gospel relieve readers of legalistic condemnation and empower them for joyful obedience by engendering fresh love for the Savior.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A perfect choice for gift-giving or personal encouragement, Fitzpatrick&#39;s book helps active women grasp the practicality of the gospel message and experience its deep comforts.&lt;/p&gt;" />
