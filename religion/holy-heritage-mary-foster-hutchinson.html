  <title>Holy Heritage - Mary Foster Hutchinson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Holy Heritage traces the journey of the Anglican faith from its first flowering on the ancient island of Brittania through its emigration in the sixteenth century to the New World and transplantation to a wild, neglected area of a strange land called Texas. There, in 1856, after a long, historic struggle for survival, this faith was firmly planted as the Parish Church of Saint Matthew in a tiny village called Dallas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The reader is invited to accompany that first parish through the struggles of the Civil War and the Reconstruction era, following its transformation into a cathedral church. Each tenure of its nineteen fascinating deans is detailed along with the parallel growth of the city each served, never forgetting the frontiersmen whose struggles made it all possible.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, the reader will also learn why an Irishman called Alexander Charles Garrett is called the Apostle of Texas as well as which of the pioneer Dallas clerics was the first man to climb Mount McKinley, wrote a book in Japanese, was born in Scotland, and was killed in action during the Civil War  and what happens next.&lt;/p&gt;" />
