  <title>The New Life - Betty A. Burnett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book was inspired by God and written to give hope to the lost (unsaved) and to the saved (born again believers).God is the only One who knows where you arewhats in the heart of each personbut wherever you are, there is hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of author Betty Burnetts life experiences are written in the book to help you to identify and locate yourself. Additionally, her experiences will allow you to see the kind of drama she had in her life and what a basket case she was. You will also see that some of her experiences seemed hopeless, but God gave her hope through people He put in her life to exemplify His great love, which brought life to her situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book will give you a better understanding of salvation, which will give you more hope. As you grow into knowledge and understanding through the word of God, something that takes time, you will begin to have a different out look on life. You will understand that everybody has their own problems and that somebody elses experience and how they overcame will encourage you to keep moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;" />
