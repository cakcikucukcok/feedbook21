  <title>Truth and Consequences - Ralph E. Carlson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Have you ever asked the question, does God exist? Have you ever wondered about the source of life on earthand in particular, human life? Creationism, intelligent design, and evolution are three approaches to answering these questions. While evolutionists are adamant that their claim has been proven to be a scientific fact, it turns out that their so-called proof uses an invalid logical argument. Hence, at this point in time, evolution is merely a conjecture and not a scientific fact.
Instead of attempting to answer these questions through inductive arguments, Truth and Consequences offers a different logical approach that restates the questions as propositions. A proposition is a statement that is either true or false. Then the consequences of their respective truth values can be analyzed. The first proposition is: an Infinite Intelligent Entity (IIE) exists. If that proposition is true, it leads to a second proposition: the IIE created life on Earth, and in particular, human life. If both propositions are true, it leads to a third proposition: there is life after death. If any of these propositions are false, the bottom line is that it leads to a dead end.
Ultimately, if these foundational propositions are true, it leads to a fourth proposition: Jesus lived some two-thousand years ago. By continuing to build on these propositions and follow their conclusions, we can better discuss not only the existence of God as such but also contemporary issues like modern-day threats to Christianity in America." />
