  <title>Funny Stuff in the Bible: A Field Trip in the Bible Library - Phillip D. Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Funny Stuff in the Bible is a field trip through the Bible library hunting for funny stuff. The many stories and other literature in this library were written over a period of a thousand years. This is well known. Thinking of the Bible as a library provides perspective.  Though there are more copies of this library, its writings bound into a single volume, than of any other book in the world, the literature in it is underrated and underenjoyed. It is underenjoyed because of the smog created by the notion that every word is religiously serious and not for enjoyment, let alone laughter. This overlay of morality and religious seriousness makes it difficult to read a particular story as we do other stories in the world. Funny Stuff shakes off these notions to enjoy some stories. The Bible is a large library. We can only explore a little of it as we look both for stuff that makes us laugh and also things that are strange. We investigate what we come across--stumble on, so to speak. The quest is undertaken in good humor and with light hearts." />
