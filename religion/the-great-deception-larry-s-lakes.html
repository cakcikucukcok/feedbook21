  <title>The Great Deception - Larry S. Lakes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The “watchers” have been waiting for thousands of years for opportunity to regain their formal glory. Cast down from heaven, they used their superior knowledge and physical presence among men to lead mankind to the precipice of annihilation requiring God to cleanse the earth of their presence during the great flood and restrain these fallen ones to the confines of the spiritual realm. Finally, the earth is plunged into chaos as millions of Christians are raptured to heaven. Satan has been devising his final deception for the remaining populace for centuries as he and his fellow fallen ones are once again permitted into the physical arena of mankind. Where have all the missing people gone? What explanation could possibly convince the world to give allegiance to Satan and his demonic horde? Imaginative and thought provoking answers are provided in this suspenseful tale taken from the pervasive paranormal themes that have been deeply embedded into our present day culture by powerful and popular media venues. It will be left up to the 144,000 sealed of Israel and the remnant of believers who will refuse to believe this “strong delusion” and reveal the lie during the time of great tribulation. Keep an open mind and hang on for a wild ride in a world left to the Great Deception." />
