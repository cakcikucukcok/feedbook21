  <title>The Innovative Church of the 21St Century - Patrick Isaac</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;We have entered the 21st century and the Church of Jesus Christ is facing new realities and new challenges in this millennium. The Church will have to negotiate and overcome these realities and challenges to be able to greatly advance the Kingdom of God on earth. Our society, technology, communication and information systems have taken a drastic turn. The Body of Christ cannot hope to conspicuously affect our modern society with obsolete methods and dynamics. It is imperative for the Church to innovate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This anointed and appointed work will address certain areas of optimisation and innovation vitally needed by the Church of Jesus Christ to kingdomize the earth. Whether we want it or not, the kingdom of God will dominate the earth. The instrument that God will use to make the difference in this 21st Century is an innovative and optimized, sent out Church to kingdomize the earth. My question for you is, Will you be part of the innovative Church that will change the destiny of the 21st Century?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Your determination to grasp and master these important keys in this literary work, will certainly upgrade your candidacy.&lt;/p&gt;" />
