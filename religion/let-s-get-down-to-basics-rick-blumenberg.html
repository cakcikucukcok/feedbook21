  <title>Let’S Get Down to Basics - Rick Blumenberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Lets Get Down to Basics was originally written as curriculum for a class for new Christians or people who were new to the church and to the particular viewpoint of Wesleyan-Arminiam theology. It has thirteen chapters and each chapter has review questions at the end with the answers at the end of the book, making it excellent for a class, for a personal review or for someone who wants to investigate the basics of Christianity on their own.
The book does not criticize any other religions or branches of Christianity, but is an attempt to lift up basics of the faith that are common to all Christians. There are some chapters that are particular to the Church of God (Anderson, Indiana) or to the Wesleyan-Arminian believers, but it is not written in a way that criticizes those who believe differently and might be helpful to those of other traditions so they understand beliefs from this point of view.
Chapters that fall into this category include Chapter 7 The Second Step (the doctrine of sanctification as a second definite work of grace) and Chapter 9 Develop a Lifestyle of Holiness (aiming for the goal of a holy lifestyle. Chapter 11 Signs of the Times in the Christian Life (explains ordinances of the church, including baptism and communion, two almost universal teachings of Christianity, and footwashing, which is practiced by only a few church groups. Chapter 13 The Last Chapter deals with the end times from an amillenial eschatological perspective. Even if this is not your theological view, it might be helpful for you to understand end times teaching as viewed from the amillenial perspective." />
