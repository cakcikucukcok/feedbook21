  <title>People Get Ready - Enel Malakrist</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;The last days are suddenly upon us. Unfortunately many will scoff at the idea, and only a few will recognize the season. The writing in the heavens is in plain sight of all people. Four eclipses of darkened sun and blood moons of 2015 are significant omens of coming disaster.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The author presents a bold biblical account of the events which are destined to occur in this generation. This time of the end is evidenced by the many fulfilled predicted biblical signs. Most significant are ungodliness, the falling away of Christians into paganism and worldliness, universal violence, terrorism and wars and rumors of wars. Most significantly, the recent Nuclear Treaty is a key sign of the end of the ages, and the apparent fulfillment of Daniel&amp;rsquo;s prophecy of the &amp;ldquo;Confirmed covenant with many&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Without a doubt, the date of the ratification and adoption of the Iran Treaty is the crucial prophetic date of the beginning of the last seven years of Gentile world domination. The Countdown to the end has begun in the year 2015. There is no more delay &amp;ndash; the end is at hand.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Observe that the ruthless despotic terrorist leader of the Islamic State &amp;ndash; the prophetic Antichrist, is currently waging war against the Christian nations, and persecuting all who reject their theology. The Beast foretold in the Book of Revelation is now roaming the earth, and conducting terroristic activities in many countries.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; There is restiveness among the nations, and great fear in the hearts of many people. The world is in turmoil. Political instability, civil wars, religious persecution, severe distress, hard times and economic failures are reasons behind massive exodus of millions of people from their homelands.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; A chaotic Middle East is steering the world towards World War 3. The flashpoint may well be Syria, where the world powers are engaged in battle against ISIS. Presently there is political friction and mistrust among the super powers, and also among rival Muslim nations in the region. Consequently a computer glitz, a miscalculation, or an accident involving their military could result in a war which could quickly escalate into a nuclear holocaust.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Prophecies indicate a calamitous end to the ages. The scriptures affirm that the &amp;ldquo;Times of the Gentiles&amp;rdquo; which begun six centuries BC and continues to this day will end in violence. Consequently at the time of the end, billions will perish as a result of wars, famine and pestilences according to prophecy.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The author warns of a coming Great Tribulation within a few months, and encourages people to be spiritually prepared. The time to call upon the name of the Lord is now. Bear in mind that the Christian era, which begun at the birth of Jesus 2016 years ago, and co-exist with the Times of the Gentiles will end in a few years&amp;rsquo; time according to fulfilled prophecy.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The whole world will be subjected to severe distress, and none shall escape. &amp;nbsp;However there is hope for true Christian believers, and all those who put their trust in God. &amp;nbsp;Church, get ready for the trumpet call of God. In a little while true believers will be raptured.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Soon and very soon a new era &amp;ndash; the Kingdom Age will begin with the return of Jesus Christ. The Lord will then establish His Millennial kingdom in righteousness, and bring peace, justice and order to a chaotic world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
