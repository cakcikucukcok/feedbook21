  <title>God in the Dark - Os Guinness</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;A profound and excellent book for doubters and their friends who want to help.&amp;quot; --James W. Sire, Author; campus lecturer for InterVarsity Christian Fellowship&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Clear, steady explanation of what doubt is and how it is to be dealt with. There is nothing like it in print.&amp;quot; --Dallas Willard, Professor of Philosophy, University of Southern California&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Do you have significant doubts about God? Are you afraid to doubt, much less admit to anyone that you aren&#39;t fully convinced of God&#39;s faithfulness? Are you so torn by your questions that life is losing its meaning?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This forthright but compassionate book works to tear away the layers of misunderstanding about doubt to reveal not only its dangers but its great value. As author Os Guinness explains: &amp;quot;If ours is an examined faith, we should be unafraid to doubt... There is no believing without some doubting, and believing is all the stronger for understanding and resolving doubt.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For those who are unsure of God&#39;s trustworthiness--and for those who are in a dark place, wanting to know &amp;quot;Why?&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;How long, O Lord?&amp;quot;--&lt;em&gt;God in the Dark&lt;/em&gt; is a must. It puts a human face on the problem of doubt and examines it thoroughly. In a way that will respond to your questions, settle your fears, and strengthen your faith.&lt;/p&gt;" />
