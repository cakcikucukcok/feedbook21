  <title>The Biblical Prophets for Today - Keith Malcolm Hunt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Nearly ONE THIRD of the Bible concerns Prophecy. And MOST of that prophecy is for the last 42 months of this age. 
The book of Revelation is for &quot;the Lord&#39;s day&quot; - not a day of the week, but for the prophetic time in the prophets 
of the Old Testament known as &quot;the day of the Lord.&quot; 
All nations on earth are families grown large and many of them moved, migrated, and settled in the lands where 
we find them today. 
Much recorded history down through the ages shows who the modern nations of the world are, where they came 
from, and who they were in the days of the Old Testament prophets. 
Much prophecy has a two fold fulfillment i.e. Jeremiah 30:1-9; Isaiah 11. The latter fulfillment is for the very end 
times - the last 42 months of this age - Luke 21:22 &quot;For these be the days of vengeance, that all things that are  
written may be fulfilled.&quot; 
With these basic keys we can understand the Bible prophets as they speak to us for our day and beyond into 
the last 42 months of this age, leading up to the glorious, powerful, mighty return of Christ Jesus to this earth, 
and the establishing of the Kingdom of God on earth.Nearly &lt;i&gt;ONE THIRD&lt;/i&gt; of the Bible concerns Prophecy. And &lt;i&gt;MOST&lt;/i&gt; of that prophecy is for the last 42 months of this age. &lt;p&gt;The book of Revelation is for the Lords day - not a day of the week, but for the prophetic time in the prophets of the Old Testament known as the day of the Lord. &lt;/p&gt;
