  <title>Vanishing Grace - Philip Yancey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Christians have proclaimed the good news about Jesus for centuries. But the good news isn&amp;rsquo;t sounding so good these days, at least to some. More and more surveys show that people view Christians as bearers of bad news, judgment, and intolerance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Vanishing Grace&lt;/em&gt;, bestselling author Philip Yancey acknowledges the problem and then explores how we can respond with both grace and truth. He offers a discerning look at what contributes to a hostility toward Christians, and identifies three groups&amp;mdash;pilgrims, artists, and activists&amp;mdash;who can show us a different way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a reporter&amp;rsquo;s eye and a compassionate heart, Yancey suggests practical ways in which we can live as salt and light within a society that is radically changing. What can we learn from those who shun church but consider themselves spiritual? Can the good news, once spoiled, ever sound good again?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Yancey writes, &amp;ldquo;Like a sudden thaw in the middle of winter, grace happens at unexpected moments. It stops us short, catches the breath, disarms&amp;hellip;. Yet not everyone has tasted of that amazing grace, and not everyone believes in it. In a time of division and discord, grace seems in vanishing supply. Why? And what can we do about it?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the wake of recent events&amp;mdash;Las Vegas, Charlottesville, Charleston, Ferguson, Islamic terrorism&amp;mdash;people both inside and outside the church are thirsty for grace. &lt;em&gt;Vanishing Grace &lt;/em&gt;calls us to see their thirst, and ours, in a hopeful new light as we listen, love, and offer a grace that is truly good news.&lt;/p&gt;" />
