  <title>You Are Free - Rebekah Lyons, Ann Voskamp</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You don&#39;t have to keep striving for freedom; live in the freedom you already have in Christ. In these pages, Rebekah Lyons walks you through her journey of releasing stress, anxiety, and worry to uncover the peace that is offered to us through Jesus Christ.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you bought the lie?&amp;nbsp;Many of us do. We measure our worth by what others think of us. We compare and strive, existing mostly for the approval of others. Pressure rises, fear and anxiety creep in, and we hustle to keep up.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Jesus whispers,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;I gave my life to set you free. I gave you purpose. I called you to live in freedom in that purpose.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;Yet we still hobble through life, afraid to confess all the ways we push against this truth, because we can&#39;t even believe it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christ doesn&#39;t say you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be or &lt;em&gt;may &lt;/em&gt;be or &lt;em&gt;will &lt;/em&gt;be free. He says you&lt;strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;are &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;free.&amp;nbsp;Dare you believe it?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;You Are Free&lt;/em&gt;, Rebekah invites you to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overcome the exhaustion of trying to meet the expectations of others and rest in the joy God&#39;s freedom brings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Find permission to grieve past experiences, confess areas of brokenness, and receive strength in your journey toward healing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throw off self-condemnation, burn superficial masks, and step boldly into what our good God has for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discover the courage to begin again and use your newfound freedom to set others free.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Freedom is for everyone who wants it--the lost, the wounded, and those weary from all of the striving. It&#39;s for those who gave up trying years ago. It&#39;s for those angry and hurt, brilliant and burnt by the Christian song and dance. You are the church, the people of God. You were meant to be free.&lt;/p&gt;" />
