  <title>The Devil Made Them Do It at Tiny Town Church - Sophie Baker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Rescue the perishing Care for the dying Duty demands it This is a motivational message for those called by God to save our dying churches. We are called to serve We are called to save! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Devil Made Them Do it at Tiny Town Church is a true story about how Satan and his band of devils infiltrated a major denomination and one of the small membership churches in its charge and attempted to dismantle and destroy the church, its mission and vision, its pastor, and its congregation. It isnt just about a set of specific circumstances in one small place. It tells a greater story; it tells the continuing saga of humanity at its worst. The story at the Tiny Town Church just happens to express itself through this one small place and the things that happen when people lose their focus on God and focus, instead, on themselves and their own agendas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lessons that were learned from the Tiny Town experience show us that this is a problem that knows no denominational boundary. For where the Holy Spirit is alive in the people of God, there will be evil trying to destroy their good fruits!&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Wake up! Spread the Word! Satan is real! He is alive! He wants nothing more than to destroy the worship of our Lord. What better place to start than in the small membership church? Who is sitting in the pew next to you?&lt;/p&gt;" />
