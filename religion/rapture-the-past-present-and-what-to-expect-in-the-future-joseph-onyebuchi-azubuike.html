  <title>Rapture: the Past, Present and What to Expect in the Future - Joseph Onyebuchi Azubuike</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It is now clear,  the controversy on Rapture is over as God sent Joseph Onyebuchi Azubuike declares that Jesus teaching on his second coming is the ultimate. He is coming Post trib immediately after not before the tribulation of those days Matt 24:29-31. All other views including the most popular Pretrib are assumption based. There is no single scripture that suggests Rapture before the tribulation of those days. But assumption which is not the word of God can work it out for you. Therefore, whose report will you believe? We have swallowed enough heresies in the past but it has come to an end today, because the Structures refute the heresies. Do not hesitate to pick the book and you will be glad you did.&lt;/p&gt;" />
