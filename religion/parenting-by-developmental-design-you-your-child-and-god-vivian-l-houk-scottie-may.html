  <title>Parenting by Developmental Design: You, Your Child, and God - Vivian L. Houk, Scottie May</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this book, Vivian Houk acknowledges that parenting is really hard work. There is no getting around that. It just is! While many books have been written about all major areas of development, she brings light to what may be the least understood and most confusing area of parenting today: the spiritual lives of their children. Parenting by Developmental Design was written for interested and engaged parents who need affirmation and want to know more about the pathway of spiritual formation for their children. For those who don&#39;t know how to begin, it offers hope and encouragement. God has given us some amazing and powerful tools, writes Houk, which are useful and effective in providing direction for those of us who suffer from the fear of failure or incompetence. We have the gift of imagination; the use of symbol, ritual, and celebration; and the tools for calming fears and healing wounds. And above all, the gift of the Holy Spirit. You are not alone or incapable. Anyone who values the stories of both the adult and child who walk with God will find this book enjoyable, engaging, and challenging." />
