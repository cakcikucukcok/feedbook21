  <title>Birth, Criminal History and Judgment of the Roman C. Church - Luis Mu単oz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book uses history and the Bible to offers a fresh and scriptural interpretation of passages of the Bible which for centuries remained a mystery to the student of Bible prophecy, including Mystery, Babylon the great, the mother of harlots and of the abomination of the earth. I will explore the myths and deception of Roman Catholicism and their direct connection with the idolatrous worship system of the Mother and Child of ancient Babylon. The claims that Roman Catholicism is the only true Church of Christ on Earth and the claim that man cant find salvation apart from her is the greatest deception the world has ever known. Centuries of moral crisis and sexual abuse of children speak volumes about the true nature of the leaders of the Catholic Church. The abhorrence of marriage and the negative view of women recorded in the Canon Laws clearly reflect the Vaticans Gnostic belief on sexual intercourse and the imposition of celibacy. Many people throughout the world equate Christianity with everything that is vile, contemptible and depraved. 
For centuries the Roman C. Church suppressed basic human rights and also persecuted and murdered anyone who held beliefs which conflicted with the dogma of the church. During the horrors of the Inquisition tens of thousands of people were tortured, dismembered, beaten, and burned alive, all in the name of a fraudulent faith. Roman Catholicism is the false representation of truth and also the cause great many people throughout history have repudiated true Christianity. The history of crimes the papacy has committed throughout history is so compelling that it would inevitably lead any objective thinker to the conclusion that throughout the history of the world there hasnt been any other organization as notorious as the Roman C. Church. The long history of cruelty, crimes and immorality that for centuries the church of Judas has committed on every generation, provides irrefutable proof that she is not of God." />
