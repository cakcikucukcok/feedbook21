  <title>The Housing System - S. K. Oddoye</title>
      <meta name="description" content="No one is under any obligation to believe the Housing System anymore than anyone is obliged to believe the truth, but we do owe it to ourselves to examine the evidence presented in this book to see whether it stacks up or not. Whether you believe in magic or not, for example, is unlikely to affect your eternal destiny directly, but your response to this book is more likely to bring to bear eternal consequences of the most profound magnitude.
Consider, for instance, that it is the Bible that says there are different types of Christians (1 Corinthians 11:19). Also, if heaven is the reward for all Christians who receive the free gift of salvation, then who are the Christians who are forcing their way into the kingdom of heaven, and what is the difference? (Matthew 11:12). Or could the clue to this be hidden in Leviticus 10:10 and Romans 9:21?
Martin Luther was right to reform the church in the sixteenth century. We too must do the right thing now, for God is showing this ministry many things reserved for the end-times, which call for us to go beyond mere reformation and be transformed into a glorious church." />
