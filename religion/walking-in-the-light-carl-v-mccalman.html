  <title>Walking in the Light - Carl V. McCalman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;&lt;CENTER&gt;Basic Instructions for Every Believer in Christ&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/CENTER&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Walking In The Light&lt;/i&gt; is a God-inspired book which provides sustenance and basic instructions for people who are thirsty for God. It offers guidance to new Christians who have found faith in Christ and need wisdom to continue, and, support to Believers who have lost their zeal for God and need to be renewed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pastors seeking sound instructions to help their congregations mature, as well as the Bible Teacher and Evangelist with a burden for Gods people will find this narrative very useful. Inspiring scriptures, many types of prayers and the blessing have been added and make reading most delightful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These Basic Instructions for Every Believer are clearly shown as the building-blocks for a successful Christian life: success which does not happen but is caused...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Walking In The Light&lt;/i&gt; provides a clear understanding of the new birth, the baptism in the Holy Ghost, the key to financial blessings and shows the importance of the guidance of our Lord in our walk of victory.&lt;/p&gt;" />
