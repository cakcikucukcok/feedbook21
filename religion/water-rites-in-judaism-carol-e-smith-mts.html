  <title>Water Rites in Judaism - Carol E. Smith  Mts</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The motivation for choosing this study comes from this writers curiosity regarding the origins of water baptism and the link between water baptism and Spirit baptism in relationship to the church and Christianity. From the time I began studying the Bible many years ago I have been passionate about wanting to trace how religious practices and beliefs in Judaism may align with contemporary Christian practices and beliefs. The origins of Christianity are permeated in ancient Jewish religious practices and beliefs. Yet many Christians lack information and therefore understanding about the Jewish legacy handed down to the church. Most Christians accept that water baptism is necessary to be a part of the Christian Church. They do not question who, what, when, how or why regarding the practice of water baptism. 
This writer intends to furnish information and argument supporting origins of water baptism. This project is largely written for contemporary Christians, but it is hoped that it will benefit all other serious inquirers of truth as well. It is the writers proposal to furnish background necessary to articulate a knowledgeable answer to the question What are the origins/roots of water baptism? Archaic modes of ceremonial water rituals will be explored to assist Christians in understanding the underpinnings of the origins of Christian religious practices and beliefs. The list of works consulted, though not exhaustive, covers publications authored over nearly a century, which permits the author to explore scholarship on the timeless subject of origins of water rites. 
The writers purpose for this study goes forth with the hope of spurring contemporary Bible-based Christians into exploring roots/origins of water baptism. The rite of water baptism (Acts 2:38) did not begin on the day of Pentecost when the church was formulated, as many Christians today believe. Water rites or baptism was a religious practice of Judaism before Christianity." />
