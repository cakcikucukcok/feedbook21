  <title>This I Know - Patricia Martin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Anyone going through struggles in life will want to read this book. This world can be a lonely place, but there are life changing answers. We all relate to stress, sorrow, dysfunctional relationships and personal identity problems. There is &quot;a light at the end of the tunnel&quot; for every hungry heart.
The author candidly shares her walk with God through divorce, single parenting, illness, a dysfunctional childhood, occult teachings, controlling church life, and much more. It doesn&#39;t stop there, for out of her &quot;dark places and chains&quot; comes the hand of Almighty God, bringing deliverance and freedom in life.
The author tells how God faithfully demonstrates His tender love and mercy in the lives of anyone seeking Divine intervention. Personal miracles are shared, along with life application principles that transform even the most desperate of life&#39;s circumstances. Knowing how much God loves you personally gives the ability to &quot;fly above the storm,&quot; just as eagles soar above the clouds." />
