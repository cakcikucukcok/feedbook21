The positive phrases herein contained are intended to be a source of encouragement, challenge, and incentives to action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, these sentences will stimulate your creative mind in developing your own appetizers which can become an additional source of encouragement to those you interact with.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Words fitly spoken, or recorded on paper, often contribute to the wellbeing of individuals, families, and nations.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Appetizers for the Soul&lt;/em&gt; deserves the full attention of many readers on account of the distilled wisdom which the author offers with each thought. Dr. Lyra is a regular columnist for the newspaper I publish, and I can testify to the manifold, enthusiastic responses his writings always elicit from the reading public. I know the same will be the case with those who shall benefit from this precious volume!&lt;br /&gt;
