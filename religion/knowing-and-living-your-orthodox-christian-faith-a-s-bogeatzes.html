  <title>Knowing and Living Your Orthodox Christian Faith - A.S. Bogeatzes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="From the time you were in your childhood, did you begin to wonder what the meaning is of your Orthodox Christian beliefs? Especially, what the significance is of the prayers, hymns, the Epistle and Gospel readings, and communion during the Divine Liturgy? As you get older you may read books about the Orthodox Christian Church, attend religious education workshops and seminars, and look at video tapes; and start to compile the answers to the questions you had. This book helps you to better understand  the doctrines, beliefs, the Holy Traditions, the faith, sacraments, and worship of the church. Also in this book, you comprehend a very important aspect as to how the Christian religion got started, and the connection of the Orthodox Christian Church to our Lord Jesus Christ, His apostles, the early church fathers, and the Seven Ecumenical Councils. This puts you on a path where you regularly attend, participate in, and better understand the Divine Liturgy. You learn that the Divine Liturgy in the Orthodox Christian Church has remained the same for more than 1500 years. You begin to understand that the Orthodox Christian Church is the true path to Jesus. When you begin to read the Holy Bible daily, you learn about the ministry of Christ and how to better live our lives. We should regularly say our daily morning prayers and nightly prayers, and our special prayers when needed. The fruit of prayer is inner peace, healing power, the Holy Spirit, union with God, and love. If we still have doubts in our minds about the existence of a mighty power, our God, then all we have to do is to look all around us. Everything is arranged in an orderly manner, and there is a grand purpose in every aspect of the human, animal, and plant kigndoms - and the planet earth within an infinite universe. The evidence that is presented in this book truly confirms that God is with us and all around us." />
