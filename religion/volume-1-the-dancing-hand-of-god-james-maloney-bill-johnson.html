  <title>Volume 1 the Dancing Hand of God - James Maloney, Bill Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Dancing Hand of God: Unveiling the Fullness of God through Apostolic Signs, Wonders, and Miracles combines two purposes in each of its two volumes. This first volume begins the journey that will unveil the qualities of God by telling the story of the life of its author, James Maloney, and by exploring the apostolic witness to God. He likens the approach to discovering a balance between storytelling and teaching that helps the reader to turn the face of a hurting world toward God.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This volume of The Dancing Hand of God explores Gods fullness, fatherhood, otherness, acceptance, burden, glory, rule, and availability. Each of the chapters concludes with an outline that lists the main insights offered by each of the sections in the chapter, making the book useful both for ones personal reflection and for shared conversation.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you take stock of your spiritual life, you might find yourself confronting a series of challenges, such as loneliness, anxiety, and a lack of godliness. The Dancing Hand of God proposes a remedy for these sources of spiritual sickness: a full-contact embrace in the strong and healing hands of God. By learning from James Maloneys own journey and his studied explorations of the teachings of the faith, you will find the energy to play your part in unveiling Gods fullness through your working of apostolic signs, wonders, and miracles.&lt;/p&gt;" />
