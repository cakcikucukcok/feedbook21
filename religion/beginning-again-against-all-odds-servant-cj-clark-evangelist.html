  <title>Beginning Again...Against All Odds! - Servant Cj Clark Evangelist</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As we get closer to the end of times aka last days, we observe more Christians embracing the trends and traps of this world rather than upholding Gods standards of a more excellent way (1 Corinthians 12:31).  After teaching the Gospel of Jesus Christ for about forty years, it is evident to me that the spiritual fruit manifested through every believer begins at the root (formative years) of their spiritual foundation. If Christians have been taught to live life with one foot resting on Old Testament practices of the Law and legalism, and the other foot resting on the New Testament principles of grace and liberty, their lives will reflect frustration and ultimate confusion, because double-doctrine teaching neutralizes the effectiveness of the Word of God. Consequently, many Christians continue to struggle with surrendering to the plain, profound, and sound truth that Salvation is based on faith in Jesus Christ (Romans 10:9), alone.  It is not earned through academic or theological education, social status, good behavior, penance, or ones financial portfolio!  Thus, it is the responsibility of every Gospel Leader to mentor, model, preach and teach the gospel of Jesus Christ without compromise, diminish or downplay the role of the Holy Spirit, nor attempting to dilute Gods pure, potent, powerful and soul-saving Word through personal interpretation!  This book is written to encourage new Christians of the importance in remaining faithful to God throughout their life, as well as inspire those who have become frustrated, living a double-minded lifestyle to re-launch their journey in Christ with a renewed mindset, understanding that the Saints are called to standup and standout for the cause of Christ, against all odds!&lt;/p&gt;" />
