  <title>3 in 1 - Norman B. Mitchell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The ministry, crucifixion, and resurrection of Jesus Christ were necessary for salvation and forgiveness of sin so that you could possess eternal life. Eternal life is to know God the Father and the One He sent, Jesus. Therefore, daily reading, meditation, and hearing, speaking, and obeying the Word of God will provide you with the knowledge of who you are in Christ. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With 3 in 1A Personal New Testament, you will be able to become who you are in Christ by growing in knowledge, understanding, and wisdom through revelation, meaning, and application of Gods word of truth. It is designed to help believers make a personal confession and profession of the Word, and it combines personalized scriptures, a personal devotional, and a personal journal that will guide you through the Bible in one year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing who you are in Christ will transform you by renewing your mind. Then you will know Gods good, pleasing, and perfect will as you grow in righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit. So take your stand and find strength in the Lord as you wear the full armor of God, for you are being sanctified while becoming who you are in Christ.&lt;/p&gt;" />
