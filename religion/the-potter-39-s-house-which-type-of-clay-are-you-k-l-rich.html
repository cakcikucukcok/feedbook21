  <title>The Potter&#39;s House: Which Type of Clay Are You? - K L Rich</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;THE POTTER&#39;S HOUSE: Which Type of Clay Are YOU?&quot; will help you get to know God as your Potter and you as His clay. There is a special intimacy that takes place between the Potter and the vessel He desires to make. He has designed you with purpose and just as clay has to be shaped, molded, spun and placed in the fire, the Potter has to do the same thing with all His children. Some clays are easier to mold than others, but once the Potter is done, every piece of clay that was once shapeless will have a PURPOSE as determined by Him. Sometimes, we get sidetracked and broken, but the Potter aims to fix our broken pieces and RESTORE us back to the vessels we were meant to be at the Potter&#39;s House. YOU are special to the Potter and in His eyes, you are absolutely priceless." />
