  <title>Wealth Unfailing - Terry Wellman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="We all face trials, tribulations, and temptations in life. I have written this book for your days and nights to be full of comfort and for you to have peace in your thoughts and emotions. It is my prayer that each reader experiences this in such a way that you have never seen or felt before and that great joy and celebration will overtake you through the power of the Holy Spirit, the Living God, Jesus Christ. Amen. 
This book can be used as a day-by-day reading reference in the application of its principles to ones given situations or curiosities in or about what the Bible says about life and finances. I suggest reading the book in its entirety first and then start from any point in it that you so desire and just choose a scripture or scriptures that may apply to your situation or curiosity. This can be done on a daily basis or as oftentimes as you may feel the need to or to assist you in developing your own interpretation of what that scripture means to you or how it applies to your scenario.
I am more than hopeful and confident that you will find great peace, comfort, and guidance that you have never known." />
