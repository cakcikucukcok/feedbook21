  <title>Somewhere Under the Rainbow… - Liza Zvezda</title>
      <meta name="description" content="One womans story of contracting HIV and how it is not the end of the world
This book is my story. The opinions expressed are that of my own and hold weight only in my world. My world of HIV and all that it takes to overcome  something that was once considered a fatal disease. 
A disease that still carries  stigma and fear to the public. A walking death sentence that people dont understand doesnt have to be that way.
My hope is to open the eyes, ears and hearts of all those who read it. To educate the uneducated over a disease that is still as prominent  today as the day it started to invade our lives , taking  those we loved. 
  I want to share my  deepest feelings, my darkest moments, my  dreams and my live story in hopes to make a difference on how people view this disease. 
To gain insight to what it takes to walk in the shoes of someone who has a terminal illness that there is still no cure for.  To let it be known my name is Liza I am Hiv+ and thats ok.." />
