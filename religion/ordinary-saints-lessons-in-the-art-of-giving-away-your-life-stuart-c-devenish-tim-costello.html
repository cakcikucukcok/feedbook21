  <title>Ordinary Saints: Lessons in the Art of Giving Away Your Life - Stuart C. Devenish, Tim Costello</title>
      <meta name="description" content="How does God manifest himself in the world? Through the righteous lives of his holy people (the saints). As a religion of witnesses, Christianity is dependent upon its saints (defined as activated disciples) to &quot;testify&quot; to the grace of Christ and the kingdom of God. Their lives are walking billboards of the value of Jesus&#39; teaching and authenticity of Christianity as an ancient spiritual pathway. This is a book about saints who are alive now, and whose everyday acts of kindness and goodness announce that God is at work in the world. Like Jesus, their Master, they are the message, the messenger, and the working model of the kingdom of God, in a lesser key. In following Jesus, ordinary saints are willing to give away their lives in order to convey the substance of their faith to a watching world. If ever there was a time when saints need to live courageously for Christ in the world, it is now. But it will take conviction, credibility, and a great deal of audacity. Ordinary Saints explores what it means to be a saint in the twenty-first century, by exploring the depth-dimensions of saints&#39; lives, bodies, emotions, values, and relationships." />
