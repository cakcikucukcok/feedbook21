  <title>The Bride and the Sword - Scharlotte Celestine</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book was written to inspire you to seek a deeper revelation of Gods Word through his Holy Spirit. The Word of God is off the chain, as Paul writes in 2 Timothy 2:9, but you must immerse yourself in it to receive the revelation of this truth. When you open the Bible and read, miracles happen. It causes transformation in your life, it builds up an invisible armor around you, it breaks down walls of separation between you and Gods presence, and it also brings reconciliation and heals soul wounds. When you know his truth, it sets you free from things of this world and things you didnt even know you were chained to or in bondage to. This book shares insight into the effectiveness of a servants heart and the birth of miracles through faith in God and obedience to his word and will for you. Most importantly, it promotes a divine relationship with our Father, Savior, and the Holy Spirit, in order to lead us and guide us as ambassadors of Christ while being empowered by the Holy Spirit to continue His purpose in this earth through his children. Father God wants his bride prepared for the wedding feast when Jesus returns! Father God waits for you with open arms! What are you waiting for? Dive into the deep water of his word, and the revelation and be fulfilled!&lt;/p&gt;" />
