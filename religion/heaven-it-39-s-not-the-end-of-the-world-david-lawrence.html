  <title>Heaven: It&#39;s not the end of the World - David Lawrence</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In an unstable and pain-filled world, how can Christians aspire to be a people of hope?
Does the Bible really lead us to expect a future life in a vague, ethereal realm called &#39;heaven&#39;, whilst this earth heads for the cosmic incinerator? 
David Lawrence&#39;s book, Heaven: it&#39;s not the end of the world challenges Christians to rediscover a biblical understanding of Christ&#39;s promises for our future.
The visions in this book of a restored and healed creation may well change the way you think about heaven. This book not only explains key biblical concepts – it also holds immediate, practical implications for Christians concerned for mission,
social justice and environmental issues in today’s world.
In the wake of the disastrous events of 9-11 and other terrorist attacks, many people are asking questions and searching for answers about heaven and eternal life. Scripture Union have therefore reprinted this excellent, thought-provoking book which gives a trustworthy summary of the Bible&#39;s teachings on wispy spirits, clutching harps and singing the Hallelujah Chorus! With biblical foundations and vision, the final chapter in particular explores the contemporary implications of heaven." />
