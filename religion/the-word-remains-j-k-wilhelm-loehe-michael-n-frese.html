  <title>The Word Remains - J.K. Wilhelm Loehe, Michael N Frese</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This collection of excerpts comes from L&amp;ouml;he&amp;rsquo;s extensive writing on mission, pastoral theology, history, and liturgy. Originally published in German in 2008,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The Word Remains&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;is the English translation of a delightful book that gathers his profound wisdom into one small volume, making it well suited for devotional reading. In these pages, L&amp;ouml;he articulates the confessional Lutheran understanding of the church year, the Word of God, and matters related to the Christian life: faith, prayer, fellowship, worship, creation, and hope. In addition, the biography by Hans Kre&amp;szlig;el and the appended essay by John T. Pless give insight into L&amp;ouml;he&amp;rsquo;s life, the context in which he lived, and his lasting influence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johann Konrad Wilhelm L&amp;ouml;he (1808-1872) was a parish pastor for thirty-five years in the German village of Neuendettelsau. While he was known there as an exceptional preacher, liturgist, teacher, and Seelsorger, his work and influence also extended far beyond his own congregation. L&amp;ouml;he had a keen interest in mission work and was instrumental in sending missionaries to North America and other continents. In addition, his desire to carry out Christian labors of love for those closer to home&amp;mdash;caring for the body as well as the soul&amp;mdash;led him to found an institute in Neuendettelsau to train deaconesses to perform acts of physical mercy.&lt;/p&gt;" />
