  <title>Doing the Greater Work - Dr. Frank S. Smith Th.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Doing the Greater Work basic training. This book is designed to facilitate individual and group discussions on several ways to hone your mind and thought processes.&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Prior to Jesus beginning his public ministry, He performed the greater work within Himself. His preparation for public work serves as the building block of this book.&lt;p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;How did Christ order His own mental and spiritual life? Well, Jesus declared that the words He spokeas well as the mighty acts He performedwere a direct result of His interaction with the Father.&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Although many believers focus primarily on the outer workings (i.e., healing, laying on of hands, etc.), this book does not.&lt;p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;The challenges we face each day in doing the greater work is a lifelong process. We must be proven faithful to the Father before we can do the unprecedented exploits for the Kingdom of God.&lt;p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;The apostle Paul encouraged his followers to let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus (Philippians 2:5). These words serve as a foundation for this book.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing the Greater Work provides biblical models and practical examples that will help you develop a greater works mentality.&lt;/p&gt;" />
