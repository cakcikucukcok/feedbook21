  <title>Intuition and the New Age - Robert L. Crosman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The purpose of life on earth is to realize who we are. Traditionally this had been called enlightenment, Self realization, salvation or being born again. The course of Self realization cannot be followed by reason alone or by faith or intuition alone but only in a balanced approach that includes both reasoned thought and intuition. Mankind in this current time is overburdened by thought which produces an overemphasis on doing and achieving whatever is sought in the future. In general, people consider life to be a brief struggle to gain standing among their fellows. People seek name fame and fortune in an effort to be special, to stand out or get ahead in life.
Self realization or awareness of awareness as identity frees the mind from thought as identity and allows an entirely different understanding to motivate action. The individual becomes completely integrated in the one living Reality that is timeless, and needs no effort to be completely at peace as mankind. Words cannot express the nature of Self Realization and the worlds scriptures and holy books are written to help those who feel incomplete to free themselves from all suffering and negativity.
This book is a study in intuition and a commentary on the nature of meditative practice. Meditation or concentrated attention reveals progressive awakening and freedom from the need to awaken as I AM. The intention of the reading is to awaken intuition or deepen its presence. Stillness of mind is infinitely attractive to the human soul and when thinking mind becomes allied with intuition the sense of peace and joy exists as the finality of understanding. There is no downside." />
