  <title>Everything Is Sacred: Spiritual Exegesis in the Political Theology of Henri de Lubac - Bryan C. Hollon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It is well known that Henri de Lubac&#39;s groundbreaking and highly controversial work on nature and grace had important implications for the Church&#39;s relationship to culture and was intended to remove a philosophical obstacle hindering Catholicism&#39;s faithful engagement with the secular world. This book addresses a too-often neglected dimension of de Lubac&#39;s theological renewal by examining the centrality and indispensability of spiritual exegesis in his oeuvre and making explicit its social and political significance for the Church&#39;s worship and witness. In addition to exploring the historical and ecclesial context within which he worked, the current work brings de Lubac into a critical engagement with the more recent theological movements of postliberalism and radical orthodoxy in order to demonstrate the enduring significance of his theological vision." />
