  <title>Liturgical Signs and Symbols: An Introduction to the Rites of RCIA - Elsie Hainz McGrath</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Rite of Christian Initiation for Adults (RCIA) became mandatory in the United States in 1988. RCIA is our adaptation of Christian initiation as it was practiced in the early Church. And so, although these rites are not new, to many they are unfamiliar. This deluxe pamphlet explains RCIA in a way that will help both catechumens and &quot;cradle Catholics&quot; understand the rich tradition of Christian Initiation for adults.  Explaining that RCIA is a process, Liturgical Signs and Symbols describes the steps that candidates and catechumens walk as they begin their journey into the Church. The Rite of Enrollment, followed by Rites of Scrutinies and Presentations lead ultimately to the Sacraments of Initiation (Baptism, Confirmation, Eucharist) at the Easter Vigil. The RCIA process continues throughout the Easter season as the newly initiated pass through &quot;Mystagogy,&quot; or mystery, receiving further instruction about what it means to partake in the Paschal Mystery.  &lt;i&gt;Liturgical Signs and Symbols is a concise, understandable, and inspiring introduction to the RCIA process.  &lt;i&gt;Deluxe pamphlet&lt;/i&gt; Nonreturnable" />
