  <title>Get out of the &#39;&#39;Dry Places!&#39;&#39; - D. R. Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;This is the second book in the &lt;B&gt;HELP&lt;/B&gt; (Hope, Empowerment, Love, Prayer) Series.  It is a journey through every day living that confronts and validates the emotions aroused by disappointments, insecurities, impatience, major setbacks, failed relationships, frustrated aspirations and feelings of helplessness about present circumstances.  Often, life can cause many people to feel less than inspired and optimistic about the future.  Bouts of disillusionment and periods of difficulty cause folks to question life and immediately transport them to what this author calls, DRY PLACES.&lt;/P&gt;  
&lt;P&gt;Is there any hope?  Can anyone help? Is there any benefit from our negative experiences? Yes! GOD will help you &lt;B&gt;Get Out Of The &quot;DRY PLACES!&quot;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;The first section of the book is entitled &lt;B&gt;Praying Time&lt;/B&gt; because prayer is the very first tactic of powerful, resourceful people living in the favor of GOD. The greatest weapon believers own is the ability to employ faith-laced, fervent and continuous prayer.  There is nothing too great, too enormous, or too terrible for prayer.  There is also nothing too dreadful, distressing, awkward, embarrassing, shocking, appalling and too insignificant to take to our GOD.  If it concerns the reader, it concerns GOD.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The second section of the book entitled &lt;B&gt;Press On &lt;/B&gt;tackles the issues of waiting, serving while leading, aging and employing the HOLY SPIRIT. Readers should press their way determinedly through whatever they face, refusing to set up camp in the DRY PLACES.    Scripture reminds us that neither power nor might wins our victories; rather it is by the HOLY SPIRIT.   GOD gave us the gift of HIS HOLY SPIRIT who is our advocate and defender.  We must never allow anything to keep us from seeking GOD.  Whenever we feel faint and want to give up, that is the time to press and put forth extreme effort to keep going. In our weakness, GODS strength is perfect.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The final section entitled &lt;B&gt;Praise Worthy&lt;/B&gt; is designed to inspire the use of praise for the readers positive transformation. Praise is learning to speak the goodness of the LORD no matter what happens.  Although praising GOD expresses love and releases great joy and peace, praise is also a powerful weapon in spiritual warfare.  The secret about spiritual warfare is that the battle is not ours but belongs to GOD!  The truth is when we praise GOD, HIS presence shows up in a mighty way.  This sends the enemy running with his imps cowardly scampering behind him.  GOD is omnipotent!  HE is all-powerful.  HE is the Supreme Being that is greater than any force anywhere.&lt;/P&gt;  
&lt;CENTER&gt;Take a PRAISE BREAK! Get Out Of The DRY PLACES and look forward to the future!&lt;/CENTER&gt;" />
