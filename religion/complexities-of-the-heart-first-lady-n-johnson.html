  <title>COMPLEXITIES OF THE HEART - First Lady N Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is a collection of poems written over 13 years ago, about real life and personal experiences. My prayer is that this book will encourage you, that you are not alone in the Game of Life and whatever complexities you face God will make a way of escape for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proverbs 4:23 Keep your heart with all diligence, For out of it spring the issues of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First Lady N Johnson is a servant of God, a wife, mother of five, a pastor, social worker, poet, speaker, singer-songwriter, visionary, charity director, and an author of several books including her best seller Trying is Not Failing; Failing is Not Trying! She has had the privilege of working with all types of people: internationally and from various walks of life, including orphans, children and young people in care, foster carers and adoptive parents, people with mental and physical challenges, and those who have addictive behaviours both nationally and internationally. She has a real passion to inspire, encourage, empower and motivate people. Her heart for international development and orphan-care has been ignited by her passion for orphan ministry, which she first discovered through her work in South Africa and subsequently in Cambodia.&lt;/p&gt;" />
