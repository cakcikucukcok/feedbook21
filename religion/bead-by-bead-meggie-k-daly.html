  <title>Bead by Bead - Meggie K. Daly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Our Mother Mary implores us to pray the Rosary&amp;mdash;but why does Mary want us to pray the Rosary? Meggie chronicles her journey from an active avoidance to a deep love of the Rosary as she shares the meditation aids and techniques that&amp;mdash;together with her insights as to why Mary wants us to pray the Rosary&amp;mdash;have redefined her relationship with the Rosary. A chapter is devoted to each of the four Mysteries of the Rosary containing Scripture for each bead of the Rosary, and beautiful color artwork for each of the 20 decades by artists such as Raphael, Murillo, Rubens, and many others. &amp;quot;Bead by Bead&amp;quot; includes a concise history of the Rosary, from its earliest beginnings to the present day. A tutorial is included for those new to this devotion and an appendix with helpful resources for those who wish to dig deeper into Catholic theology, Mariology, apologetics, spiritual growth, lectio divina, and writings of the saints. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
This book is a must read for those who pray Rosary but desire more vivid meditations and, also, for those who struggle to stay awake and focused. For those who suffer through the Rosary fighting monotony and boredom, this book is a life-changer! &amp;nbsp;And for those who remain mystified as to why anyone would pray the Rosary&amp;mdash;find out why in &amp;ldquo;Bead by Bead.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;" />
