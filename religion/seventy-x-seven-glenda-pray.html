  <title>Seventy X Seven = ? - Glenda Pray</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Life happens to all of us. Oftentimes we are ill prepared to deal with the brute-force winds of trouble that can leave us wounded and maimed. Being hurt can gouge the very life out of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a true saying that hurt people, hurt people. Humans are daily at risk of hurts being inflicted upon us by parental, sibling, marital, peer, coworker, or church relationships. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the greatest threats to divine fulfillment and living a fulfilling life is unforgiveness. Its tentacles attach to every area of our lives, choking Gods potential, power, purpose, and promise right out of us. It is an untreated disease in our world and sad to say, so often in the church. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many are our afflictions, but God has promised to deliver us out of them all. He wants to heal our hurts and set us free from unforgiveness. I believe that the door of escape from the things that afflict and cripple our lives is being forgiven and giving forgiveness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you or someone you know struggles with unforgiveness and bitterness, this book can help. It is a candid conversation, a practical perspective, a challenge for the heart, a refreshing for the soul, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;" />
