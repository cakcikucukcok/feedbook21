  <title>Gods Everlasting Covenant - John Gill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The time of John Gill was far different. Search for knowledge was just reaching its full height after the world had crawled out of the Dark and Middle ages. Between 1735 and 1738 The Cause of God and Truth appeared from Gill&#39;s pen and was a masterpiece in presenting the truth of God&#39;s sovereignty and man&#39;s depravity. Augustus Toplady was so moved by this work that he later called Gill the greatest defender of the doctrines of grace since Augustine. The current book is a series of sermons by Dr Gill on the Everlasting Covenant that belongs to His people." />
