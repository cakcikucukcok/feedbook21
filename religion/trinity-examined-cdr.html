  <title>Trinity - Examined - Cdr</title>
      <meta name="description" content="God is one, not three. Deut. 6:4, Hear O Israel, the Lord our GOD IS ONE LORD.  1 Cor. 8:6, There is but ONE GOD: THE FATHER, of whom all things, and we in him. James 2:19, 1 Tim. 2:5, There is ONE GOD. And one MEDIATOR between God and man, the MAN JESUS CHRIST. Even the devils believe (and tremble) that there is only one God. John 17:3 says, And this is life eternal, that they might know thee THE ONLY TRUE GOD, and Jesus Christ, whom THOU HAST SENT. Eph.4:6, ONE GOD and father of all. Isaiah 43:10, Before me there was NO GOD formed, neither shall there be after me.
This Trinity is an established matter by Roman Emperor Constantine with the meeting, known as Council of Nicaea, with all bishops in 325 AD. We cannot open it again. This is the opinion of many. After all, we are not under the kings and emperors now. We are in democracy. Nobody can dictate us. Constantine was not a Christian at the time of taking that decision, and it was only later he became a Christian. He was afraid that his Roman kingdom will break down into two with the fight among bishops about this Trinity, and so he held the Nicene Council with all the Bishops simply took the majority and then declared Trinity. We need biblical support for anything, not the human dictation." />
