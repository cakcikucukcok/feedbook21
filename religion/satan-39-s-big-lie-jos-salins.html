  <title>Satan&#39;s Big Lie - Jos Salins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For nearly five hundred years the Doctrine of Predestination as
propounded by John Calvin has held sway over the western Christian
church and its theology.  Many of the major protestant denominations
are predominantly Calvinistic.
Is the Doctrine of Predestination Scriptural?
Do the Five Points of Calvinism have sound Scriptural support?
Author Jos Salins carefully examines the Five Points of Calvinism and exposes
the errors in these doctrines and the fact that none of them are supported by Scripture as assumed by Calvinists. 
He brings a new understanding of Romans chapter 9 - the chapter which
was fundamental to the formulation of the Doctrine of Predestination by
John Calvin and before him his mentor, St. Augustine of Hippo.
This book is compelling, thoroughly Scriptural and scholarly, yet written in a
style that is readable and understandable by anyone, and does not necessarily                                
require of the reader a theological background as a prerequisite.
Its content will have a tremendous impact on the Calvinistic world and on
Calvinism as a whole and will shake it to its very foundations, with far
reaching implications.
This is a must read for every thinking Christian." />
