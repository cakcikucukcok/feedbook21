  <title>Sweeping out the Demons - Rob Hefner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed reading this book and feel that it will be very useful for many persons. The way that Rob confronts the attacks by the devil are sound and solid.&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;-Dr. Bob Lamb, Professor Emeritus,&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Gardner-Webb University and the GWU School of Divinity&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;What if Matthew 12:43-45 could change your life forever? Sweeping Out the Demons will help you live closer to God every day! Rob Hefner, a missionary in Brazil for many years, will bless you and capture your interest as he guides you to recognize what spiritual warfare really is. Written from a practical, common sense approach, the suggestions and examples will serve as your basic training to be a soldier in God&#39;s Army for the 21st Century. Using personal victories over seemingly insurmountable challenges from evil influences, Rob seeks to guide you through those challenges by using a simple formula found in a rather obscure passage (Matthew 12:43-45). Jesus used this story-parable to confront some stubborn Pharisees with how make a spiritual 180 degree transformation in their lives. They simply did not listen, but you can! Are you battling with any longstanding habits, frustrations or destructive behaviors that are robbing you of greater joy, peace and strength? This book will be a study that both small groups or individuals will find as an essential weapon in order FINALLY to &quot;let go and let God&quot;!&lt;/p&gt;" />
