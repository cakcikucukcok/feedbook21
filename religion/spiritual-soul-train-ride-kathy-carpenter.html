  <title>Spiritual Soul Train Ride - Kathy Carpenter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;All aboard! Travel with me on Gods spiritual soul train! When I was three years old, I boarded a train and waved goodbye to my mother. I never saw her face again. Separated from our brother, I wrapped my arms around my sister, and God wrapped his arms around me. I did not realize at that moment that God had given me a job at that station in my life. I looked out the window and saw a blue sky of hope that I will remember always. My life is blessed in spite of this childhood heartbreak, my brothers suicide, and my sisters issues with epilepsy and suicidal tendencies. I have a remarkable life, and at each station I have been fortunate to know a God that holds me steadfast with the fascinating adventure and mystery of the world so created by him. I want you to travel with me and feel the rain upon your face, stand in awe of the descriptive sunrises and sunsets, hear the birds waking up, and picture the magnificent race horses galloping around the horse farm. Visualize the wild coyote and the white-tailed deer that dwell around me. Meet great Biblical leaders of the Bible and Christian warriors and missionaries of yesterday and today. Enjoy quotes and stories by the famous and not-so-famous but extraordinary women and men who have made and are making a difference in the world that we live in. Experience Gods seasons with me as I paint you a spring with cherry blossoms and dogwood trees surrounded by buttercups; show you the colors of autumn, highlighting the vivid oranges, yellows, and reds; smell the evergreen, pines, honeysuckle vines as I ask you to swim in their fragrance on my favorite prayer walk in the park; sit with me around the warm fires, and walk in the snow with me during Christmastime. Settle down in my snug, old barn office with hot coffee as I ask you to join me for devotional and prayer. May you exhale and inhale passion as the devotionals come alive in your heart with eternal hope and love.&lt;/p&gt;" />
