  <title>Running on Red Dog Road - Drema Hall Berkheimer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Mining companies piled trash coal in a slag heap and set it ablaze. The coal burned up, but the slate didn&amp;rsquo;t. The heat turned it rose and orange and lavender. The dirt road I lived on was paved with that sharp-edged rock. We called it Red Dog. My grandmother always told me, &amp;lsquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t you go running on that Red Dog road.&amp;rsquo; But oh, I did.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gypsies, faith-healers, moonshiners, and snake handlers weave through Drema&amp;rsquo;s childhood in 1940s Appalachia after Drema&amp;rsquo;s father is killed in the coal mines, her mother goes off to work as a Rosie the Riveter, and she is left in the care of devout Pentecostal grandparents. What follows is a spitfire of a memoir that reads like a novel with intrigue, sweeping emotion, and indisputable charm. Drema&amp;rsquo;s coming of age is colored by tent revivals with Grandpa, jitterbug lessons, and traveling carnivals, and though it all, she serves witness to a multi-generational family of saints and sinners whose lives defy the stereotypes. Just as she defies her own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Running On Red Dog Road&lt;/em&gt; is proof that truth is stranger than fiction, especially when it comes to life and faith in an Appalachian childhood.&lt;/p&gt;" />
