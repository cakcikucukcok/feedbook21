  <title>Mystical Wings - Gilda Miros</title>
      <meta name="description" content="MYSTICAL WINGS 							     ITS ALL ABOUT THE SPIRIT!
	MYSTICAL WINGS is the latest book from the actress, broadcaster and Puerto Rican writer Gilda Miros. From her previous books &quot;Memorias de los Espiritus y mi Madre and &quot;Spirit Messages to my Mother&quot; readers know that they were mother and daughter in a previous lifetime and reincarnated as daughter and mother. 
                  Upon the death of her mother Monserrate, six years ago, Gilda began receiving spirit communications and was able to channel her mother and other loving spirits from their previous lives.	
                 This touching psychic narrative by Gilda Mirs; a Chronicle of Love and Communications between two dimensions is a marvelous gift to the world. The book was compiled by Gilda as she channeled messages from the astral realm.  With this book the fear of death, once more, is dispelled and the soul soars with Mystical Wings.
From Mystical Wings: 
Message from a spirit guide:
                My beloved Gilda, we are a fraternity of spirits with a great plan; ready to transmit stories, anecdotes and messages to alleviate humanity. 
                All this has a greater goal; to rescue those who seek enlightenment, here and there. There are good but confused or maimed souls, who need a caring and guiding hand. God in his Mercy has allowed us to do this project with you; beginning a wonderful cycle of communications. How magnificent it is to know that the spirit lives on, that the souls essence lingers on, that nothing tarnishes it, nor does it end; it is wonderful.
              We have a great commitment and mission; wishing to leave our legacy of love and peace in these pages, so that everyone can satisfy their cravings and worldly anxieties, and therefore be able to climb the mountain of faith, hope, and brotherly love; working for peace on earth." />
