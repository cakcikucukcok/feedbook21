  <title>Garlands of Grace - Dawn Escoto</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Dawn Escoto has always loved poetry. She grew up on ithearing readings as well as reading, memorizing, and writing poetry. Her mother taught her to appreciate the nineteenth-century American poets, especially Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an adult, Emily Dickinson became one of her favorites. But Escoto doesnt really copy any particular poet; instead, she studies techniques from various writers and has created her own voice. Poetry runs through her veins. All of her siblings, along with cousins on both sides of the family, write poetry. She has published three volumes of poems on endangered species, under the title Going, Going, Gone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her journey as a poet began at age eight and has continued throughout her life. Since 1994 she has written over forty collections, with emphases on hymns; psalms set to music; words of encouragement; celebration of holidays and special occasions; synopses of sermons; tributes to heroes, family, and friends; endangered animals; flowers and birds; limericks; and more. This volume of poems contains examples from Garlands of Grace, Millennial Messages, Divine Sentiments, Then Sings My Soul, New Testament Psalms, New Wine, Old Wineskins, Childrens Choruses, and Tributes to Courage. It is her hope that these poems will draw you heavenward in worship of the One she exalts in her life and in her writings.&lt;/p&gt;" />
