  <title>The Spiritual Guidebook - Rita Pietrosanto</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Are you drawn to spirituality but you dont quite know where to start or what to do? Do you feel as if you are embarking on a spiritual journey, but you arent fully equipped with the tools you need?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The Spiritual Guidebook is a book designed for everyone who is new to, or drawn to the path of spirituality. It is a practical guidebook full of information, filled with terms, descriptions, ideas and reflective practices to help you along your journey in reaching self-mastery.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The Spiritual Guidebook differs from all others because it is a one-stop-shop, easy-to-follow, spiritual book of information and how-tos. It is a complete blend of the different aspects that spirituality encompasses and it draws on the learning and active practices of author, Rita Pietrosanto.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Rita makes reference to numerous inspiring authors and well-known spiritual teachers, such as Doreen Virtue, Eckhart Tolle, Gabrielle Bernstein and Louise Hay. However, Rita incorporates her learning from all the spiritual teachers she has come across along her journey, some of which are not so renowned, but are hidden gems!&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;From clearing your crystals and clearing your chakras. Connecting to your spirit guides, building on your intuition and learning to meditate. To programming pendulums and mastering the art of manifesting. The Spiritual Guidebook is an all-encompassing spiritual Bible for those starting on their journey!&lt;/P&gt;" />
