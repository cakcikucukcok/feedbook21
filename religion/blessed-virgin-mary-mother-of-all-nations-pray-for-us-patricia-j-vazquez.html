  <title>Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of All Nations, Pray for Us - Patricia J. Vazquez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is about prayers for an end to abortion. People of all faiths who believe in God can pray the prayers in this book. While praying in a Eucharistic perpetual adoration chapel in a Catholic church, Patricia witnessed a miracle there. She found the miracle was still there the following day when she returned and took pictures of this miracle. She spent time in prayer there and writing in her journal. Through inner locutions (messages) from God (while she was writing in the Eucharistic perpetual adoration chapel), God told her a new parable of a mustard seed. God asked her to write a prayer book of nine days of prayers for an end to abortions. God explained to her what the title of the book would be, how the cover of the book would appear, and how a professional portrait painter was to depict the Blessed Virgin Mary and Jesus to be standing in a field of mustard flowers. Patricia received many graces and witnessed many different miracles on her journey to bring this book to fruition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patricia shared her manuscript with six Catholic priests from different Catholic churches, and a few of their comments were: Follow Jesus; Jesus is the Way, and the Truth, and the Life; get this manuscript published; I like the new parable of the mustard seed; and getting this manuscript published, Patricia would be doing a great deed for Almighty God.&lt;/p&gt;" />
