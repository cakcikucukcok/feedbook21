  <title>The New Me in the Spirit - Dr. Rosa Drummond</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Have you ever said to God, God, you are not real to me, because you could no longer feel Him? Maybe you have had moments when you felt His strong presence, but it was only during worship or when the pastor preached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you have been saved for years and have preached to others and even taught them about God, but still you ask in difficult times, God, where are you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever felt like God does not love you because you keep telling Him I am going to give you all, only to find yourself making the same mistakes over and over again? Do you feel that God cant bless you until you get it right? Do you feel worthless because you keep missing the mark and God is punishing you? Do you see yourself the way others see you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you dont know how much God really loves you and what He has done in your spirit, you too have unanswered questions. In this book, I share only what I have learned from Gods Word and what He has revealed to others about spirit, soul, and body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The revelation of spirit, soul, and body has changed my way of thinking, which has resulted in a changed life! I now understand that there really is a New Me in the Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;" />
