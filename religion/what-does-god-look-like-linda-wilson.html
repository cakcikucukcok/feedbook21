  <title>What Does God Look Like? - Linda Wilson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When a little boy asks his mother about what God looks likeand many other questions as wellshe answers him with lots of details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This story began when author Linda Wilsons three daughters were young. This story was written and illustrated in response to their questions and the questions of many other children through the years about God. Children yearn for the literal, touchable truth about all things, including the unseen God of the universe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Understanding that truth is quite a task for children in their formative years. Their eager and open minds deserve good answers to their good questions. What Does God Look Like? seeks to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; help each child know who God is and how much He loves and cares about each of them;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; relieve any fears or misconceptions about death and reveal a biblical, pleasant picture of&lt;br /&gt;
 heaven for them; and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; reinforce the teaching that God is not only our Lord and Savior but also our comforter,&lt;br /&gt;
 teacher, and everlasting Father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What Does God Look Like? encourages each child to see Gods reflection in his or her face and to make an indelible impression on them that they are made in Gods image.&lt;/p&gt;" />
