  <title>You Are Not Going to Heaven (and why it doesn&#39;t matter) - Wes Bergen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Honesty. Humility. The purpose and future of the church. Useful and not useful parts of the Bible. A doctrine of salvation that includes mosquitoes. These are some of the topics dealt with in this controversial book. Written for those who still have hope for the church as well as those who don&#39;t, Wes Bergen&#39;s aim is to cast a vision of the church beyond divine fire insurance.   Bergen&#39;s contention is that salvation is something that either happens here and now, on this earth, or not at all. Salvation is something that happens to bodies. More importantly, salvation is something that either will happen on this earth or we risk making the world uninhabitable by human beings. Souls are irrelevant when the air is dirty, the water is undrinkable, and there isn&#39;t enough to eat. These are the things that the Bible really cares about and form the building blocks for the salvation that God offers.  This is also why this book is not about heaven. The Bible is not a manual for getting to heaven. The Bible cares very little about heaven and neither should you. Salvation is about what happens to bodies on Tuesday rather than what we do Sunday morning or what happens to souls after the body dies. Forget about heaven. Either you trust in God or you don&#39;t. Now get to work helping salvation happen." />
