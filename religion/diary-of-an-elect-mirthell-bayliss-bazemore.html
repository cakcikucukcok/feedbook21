  <title>Diary of an Elect - Mirthell Bayliss Bazemore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Diary of an Elect
Over a decade ago, I decided to write this book as a testimony to glorify our Lord and 
Savior, Jesus Christ, and to express my love for the Doctrine, which he has placed in my 
HeartTruth.
When I look back at my life from early existence until today, I have so much to be 
thankful for. I am grateful how the Lord saved me from a way that seemed right, and how I heard repentance and remission of sins preached by the late Bishop L. Hunter, which pricked my heart. I was blessed to hear the man of God over a broadcast from a radio station located in San Francisco, California. The broadcast was coming from a small town in Hartsville, South Carolina; the same Word of God, which continues to be preached today by our Pastor and General Overseer Bishop Joe C. Tisdale.
Throughout my journey, so much has occurred in my life during the writing of this book, as I was called into holiness. Deaths, backsliding, and drawn back into his Great plan of Salvation, renewed with Gods Holy Spirit in the name of Jesus Christ.
I thank God for taking me through my journey and living long enough to share with you my story; how I had encountered miracles, blessings, persecution, and those who tried to discourage me. How the Lord drew me out of a world of darkness, depression, health issues, weakness, growth, and awareness to this calling he had predestined for me as one of Gods elect.
I pray that not only my story, but others who also shared their testimony in this book, encourage you to never give up, and to embrace this calling as one of Gods chosen fewInthe Apostles Doctrine.
To God be the Glory, 
Sis. Mirthell Bayliss Bazemore" />
