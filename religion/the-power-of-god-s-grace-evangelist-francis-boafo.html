  <title>The Power of God’S Grace - Evangelist Francis Boafo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This world is increasingly becoming chaotic with sin, self-motivations, and evils. The grace of God therefore represents his love story to humanity, to help you avoid the evils of this age. Out of Gods love, he gave Jesus Christ, who came into the world full of grace. He overcame the world, and his grace wants to help you, who saved by the unmerited grace of God, to live a triumphant Christian life after your salvation. If you claim to be under grace or in grace, the fruit of grace must be evident in your life. Your claim implies you have received the word, the wisdom, and the power of God to help you live a victorious Christian life in the present age.  The effectiveness in your Christian life, in your ministry, and in the function of your gifts depends on the grace of God. The grace of God helps you overcome ungodliness and worldly lusts. Note that Jesus gives you grace for your function of your gifts and for your ministry. God expects you to find grace to help you orient your personal life to his pleasure in your attitudes, behaviors, and mindset after your gift and ministry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understand that the grace of God is not a covering, which permits you to continue in your old lifestylea lifestyle that deviates from Gods expectations for your Christian life. Rather, the grace of God is here to help you live like a champion in this world, overcoming ungodliness, worldly lusts, and to help you live soberly, righteously, and godly in this world. Among others, this is why the grace of God is the final solution to help humanity overcome the inconsistencies of the Adam generation.&lt;/p&gt;" />
