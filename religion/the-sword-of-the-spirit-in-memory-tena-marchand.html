  <title>The Sword of the Spirit in Memory - Tena Marchand</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Sword of the Spirit demonstrates a very easy method for memorizing scripture while enabling a deeper understanding of His Word. 
It will change you.
You will establish a secure and solid foundation in Christ.
You will become spiritually stronger as you face different challenges throughout life in your walk with the Lord.
You will be set free from long-term sin, habits, and attitudes that have weighed you down and affected your overall Christian experience.
You will develop a new way of thinking and discover that old ways are becoming a thing of the past.
You will experience victory rather than defeat.
You will move on to maturity more easily.
A twenty-year-old has reached adulthood, but is not as mature as his father. The young adult should not be thinking or acting like a child that is five, ten, or thirteen years old. Nothing of those ages should influence his maturity level, or he will have difficulty making it in lifeand he will know stress very well. The same applies to us as Christians if we are not actively forsaking old ways and developing new ways.
Topics include forgiveness, prayer, faith, resisting temptation, freedom from sin habits, peace, handling trials, renewing your mind, going forward, and allowing God to live through youjust to name a few of the very basic essentials for a solid platform in Christ.
These scriptures will set you free from unnecessary burdens of self that hinder your moving forward in victory. As you memorize and meditate on these scriptures, you will be set free from years of emotional baggage that guide your feelings, thoughts, reactions, and decisions. You are renewing your mind and being transformed. It is what takes place in you by the working of the Holy Spirit, God Himself, as you memorize His Worda genuine new you!
Memorizing the Bible is such a daunting task, that many people relegate it to the extremely spiritual and lose all hope of ever applying this wonderful tool to their own life. I so appreciate the humility and wisdom of Tena Marchand and this amazing tool for the believer. Without a doubt, these concepts and devotionals will help you accomplish this wonderful aspect of our faith. David had a revelation of this truth when he wrote, I have stored up Your word in my heart, that I might not sin against You (Psalms 119:11). Be blessed.
