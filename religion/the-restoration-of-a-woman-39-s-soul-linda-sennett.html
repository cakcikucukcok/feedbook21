  <title>The Restoration of a Woman&#39;s Soul - Linda Sennett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;I&gt;A Soul Restored&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
Imagine sitting in a church pew for years, Sunday after Sunday, all the while &lt;BR&gt;
struggling with the issue of blasphemy, the guilt of having an abortion &lt;BR&gt;
and not really believing you are truly saved. Imagine being a backslidden &lt;BR&gt;
Christian who, sexually abused as a child and feeling far from forgiveness and &lt;BR&gt;
redemption, searches in vain for love and acceptance in all the wrong places &lt;BR&gt;
and struggles with sexual promiscuity, drugs and alcohol. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
Perhaps visualizing this scenario isnt so hard for you, because maybe you too &lt;BR&gt;
are in a similar place of defeat. The good news, though, is that you dont have &lt;BR&gt;
to stay defeated! &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
Imagine God now revealing where you truly stand with Him and then, through &lt;BR&gt;
His mercy and love, leading you back to Him. Do you know that no matter &lt;BR&gt;
how dire or hopeless your life circumstances might seem, you can absolutely &lt;BR&gt;
overcome sin, receive Gods mercy, and live a victorious life? Know this  there &lt;BR&gt;
is actually a way out of that dark tunnel, because no matter what youve done, &lt;BR&gt;
God loves you and wants a relationship with you. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
Walk with Linda Sennett now, through the pages of a life once filled with sin, &lt;BR&gt;
condemnation and unforgiveness, till she discovered Gods amazing grace and &lt;BR&gt;
received total restoration, deliverance, reassurance, peace and freedom. What &lt;BR&gt;
God did for Linda, He can do for you, because the promise of II Chronicles 7:14 &lt;BR&gt;
is yours  If my people who are called by My name will humble themselves, and &lt;BR&gt;
pray and seek My face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from &lt;BR&gt;
Heaven, and will forgive their sin and heal their land." />
