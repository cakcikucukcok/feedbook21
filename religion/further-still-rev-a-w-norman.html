  <title>Further Still - Rev. A. W. Norman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The title Further Still was birthed out of a bible study class. The lesson was teaching on having a perfect heart toward God. The lesson went on about Christ being in the garden of Gethsemane. Christ had asked three of his disciples to accompany him so they could watch and pray with him. In the book of Matthew 26 starting at verse 36 (the b portion) it says, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder. Now if you go down to the beginning of verse 39 it says, And he (Jesus) went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying At this point . the two-word expression began to grow into my spirit and that two-word expression is the title of this book FURTHER STILL. Further Still was once a seed of thought and now has become a book to help believers, Saints, Christians, and Children of God (they all mean the same thing). How can someone be helped by reading this book? Further Still is a book about spiritual movement. This book discusses several areas of interest in the believers life where he still must go a little further. We must continue to go further still into the presence of the living God and away from sin. Now in the presence of God (this is where we are trying to get to) there are some spiritual things you will find. They are spiritual yet they have physical and tangible benefits. We will find an assurance of peace, protection, provision and most of all LOVE to such a degree that we really cant even understand it to put it into words. We just accept it!! But if we fail to make the choice to make this journey to the Father and continue to stay in our sinful state, we are in danger of making Hell our permanent home. Always remember that God is still faithful to help us if we want the help. He has provided a way of escape and his name is JESUS the CHRIST!! Youll see as you continue in this book why this journey is necessary. Move toward Jesus and you will begin to see a positive change in your life. You begin to build inside of you a correct and accurate image of who you really are. The devil wants you to see an image of lack, limitation, second class-ness, and substandard living. But God, on the other hand, wants his children to have success, prosperity, happiness, hope, love and a whole lot more." />
