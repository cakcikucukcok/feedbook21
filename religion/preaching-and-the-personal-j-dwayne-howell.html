  <title>Preaching and the Personal - J. Dwayne Howell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Preaching is a personal event: a minister or speaker prepares his or her sermon and presents it to the congregation. Preaching, however, also includes the Bible as a central source; this source comes from and provides a basis for the believing community. The preaching event is also personal for the members of the congregation, who are not simply recipients of the preacher&#39;s words based on a biblical text. The congregation is involved personally in that each individual interprets the words and the text. What is said in the text, in the sermon, and the listener&#39;s response represent parts of each one&#39;s testimony. Testimony runs throughout preaching, the Bible, and the congregation. It is in this interchange of preacher, text, and listener that not just one testimony develops but many testimonies are present." />
