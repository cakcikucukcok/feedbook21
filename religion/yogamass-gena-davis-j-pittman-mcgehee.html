  <title>Yogamass - Gena Davis, J. Pittman McGehee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="YogaMass: Embodying Christ Consciousness bridges yogic principles and practices with Christian spirituality and worship as a path for bringing the whole self (body, mind, soul, and spirit) to the experience of spiritual awakening. The author, an ordained Episcopal priest, weaves together spiritual practices from different traditions with her own discovery that yogas ancient truths are complementary with Christian beliefs  taking one deeper into the spiritual life in ways that people of diverse faiths can embrace. Blending yogic practices with Christian spirituality and worship, the Reverend Gena Davis has co-created an exciting and powerful new practice of spiritual ritual and celebration called YogaMass that leads to embodying Christ Consciousness. On and off the yoga mat, this book points the way to discovering a whole-self spiritual experience and connecting with God through an awakened open mind and heart.
I loved this book! The author, the Reverend Gena Davis, shares the story of her amazing spiritual journey that culminates in the creation of the worlds first YogaMass service. This alone would make the book well worth reading, but throughout, she integrates sacred writings, stories, and poems from spiritual masters of western and eastern spirituality, all the while never losing sight of her own Christian heritage. It is a remarkable accomplishment. You will be blessed by this book and want to share it with others.

I am delighted and privileged to encourage those who seek to worship God with all that is within to pick up and digest this spiritual teaching presented by the Reverend Gena Davis. Gena has captured the importance of worshipping God with, as the Psalmist uttered, all that is within me. I am fascinated by the interplay of yoga and liturgy within these pages, and find myself wanting to go deeper into both. I think the Reverend Davis is on to something that has been lacking in our Christian path and tradition. The interweaving of her personal narrative and the spiritual insights she gained through the study and practice of yoga unveils how Gods truth makes itself known through many different paths.
- The Reverend Dr. Richard Kleiman, retired Presbyterian pastor
Yoga is an exploration based on experiential processes. It is defined by our own internal truth! Making Yoga universal but deeply personal is something Gena Davis expresses so beautifully.
