  <title>Plain and Simple: A Journey to the Amish - Sue Bender</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;em&gt; &quot;I had an obsession with the Amish. Plan and simple. Objectively it made no sense. I, who worked hard at being special, fell in love with a people who valued being ordinary.&quot; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;p&gt;  So begins Sue Bender&amp;#39;s story, the captivating and inspiring true story of a harried urban Californian moved by the beauty of a display of quilts to seek out and live with the Amish. Discovering lives shaped by unfamiliar yet comforting ideas about time, work, and community, Bender is gently coaxed to consider, &quot;Is there another way to lead a good life?&quot; &lt;p&gt; Her journey begins in a New York men&amp;#39;s clothing store. There she is spellbound by the vibrant colors and stunning geometric simplicity of the Amish quilts &quot;spoke directly to me,&quot; writes Bender. Somehow, &quot;they went straight to my heart.&quot; &lt;p&gt; Heeding a persistent inner voice, Bender searches for Amish families willing to allow her to visit and share in there daily lives. &lt;em&gt;Plain and Simple&lt;/em&gt; vividly recounts sojourns with two Amish families, visits during which Bender enters a world without television, telephone, electric light, or refrigerators; a world where clutter and hurry are replaced with inner quiet and calm ritual; a world where a sunny kitchen &quot;glows&quot; and &quot;no distinction was made between the sacred and the everyday.&quot; &lt;p&gt; In nine interrelated chapters--as simple and elegant as a classic nine-patch Amish quilt--Bender shares the quiet power she found reflected in lives of joyful simplicity, humanity, and clarity. The fast-paced, opinionated, often frazzled Bender returns home and reworks her &quot;crazy-quilt&quot; life, integrating the soul-soothing qualities she has observed in the Amish, and celebrating the patterns in the Amish, and celebrating the patterns formed by the distinctive &quot;patches&quot; of her own life. &lt;p&gt; Charmingly illustrated and refreshingly spare, &lt;em&gt;Plain and Simple&lt;/em&gt; speaks to the seeker in each of us." />
