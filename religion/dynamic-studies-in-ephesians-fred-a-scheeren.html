  <title>Dynamic Studies in Ephesians - Fred A. Scheeren</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Welcome to an enjoyable and life-impacting study of a letter written by one of the most intelligent and educated men in history. This mans life was changed from that of a religious zealot to one of the most dedicated followers of the Jewish Messiah. The letter itself is part of our Bible and is known as the book of Ephesians.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This particular portion of Scripture has proven to be remarkable in its power over the ages.  Here we find:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	Details of the privileges enjoyed by followers of Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	Secrets of unity and relationships&lt;/p&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;	Gods formula for victorious living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fred Scheeren guides us through the book of Ephesians by relating it to the whole of scripture to help us fully realize the power of Gods Word and incorporate it into our lives. Dive into this exciting study for another life-changing encounter with the Word of God.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Gordon Haresign, an internationally known author, professor, speaker, and member of the board of directors of Scripture Union, has said, These are among the finest, if not the finest, inductive Bible studies available today. I strongly endorse them about the Dynamic Bible Studies series produced by Scheeren.&lt;/p&gt;" />
