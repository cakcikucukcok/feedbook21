  <title>Isaiah Speaks: A Voice from the Past for the Present - Merrill Morse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Meet the Isaiah you never knew. Isaiah Speaks connects this famous prophet to such concerns of modern life as Islam and world religions, family conflicts, worship, and globalization. Whether the topic is modern string theory, current per capita wine consumption, or angel sex, Isaiah has insights to offer. Into a world of religious turmoil, political intrigue, and personal searching, Isaiah brought a message of both judgment and hope. In this book, grounded in biblical and historical research, he does it again. Discussion questions, reflection exercises, and prayers help the modern reader integrate prophetic insights into daily life and faith. Get to know Isaiah better either through using this book for devotional study or for lively conversation with others. Isaiah awaits." />
