  <title>Developing Life-Changing Faith - Carole Haygood</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Developing Life-Changing Faith contains the spiritual teachings from a 7-year journey to developing the faith that changed my life. This journey started when I accidentally used faith to be healed from an infirmity that plagued me for many years. Questioning how this miracle happened, in this age, I turned to the unused pages of my Bible to find my answer. I saw what I had accidentally done that spurred the miracle, and the simple requirement hidden in plain sight, in its pages. &lt;br /&gt;
Over the following year, the Spirit showed me misconceptions that blocked my ability to develop and use faith, and showed me the common things I did that made it impossible for God to answer my prayers, essentially tying Gods hands against me. Then I was taught what the foundation of faith really isthe key or seed of faithexplaining why knowing this key is vitally important to develop the kind of faith illustrated in Bible stories. &lt;br /&gt;
Through the subsequent years, I was taught about the things for which we could pray and the things for which we should not pray, and why; the truth about tests of our faith, why they are necessary, why we should watch for them, and how to pass them every time; and how to use faith correctly, highlighting biblical keys to give a complete understanding about faith. &lt;br /&gt;
Developing Life-Changing Faith will give the readers the same teachings, understandings, tools, keys, and corrections, to develop the faith that will change their lives. It will lead them from feeling that their faith is not working, to fully understanding how to develop and correctly use faith, which will truly change their lives.&lt;/p&gt;" />
