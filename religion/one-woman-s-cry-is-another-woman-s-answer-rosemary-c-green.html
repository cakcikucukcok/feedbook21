  <title>One Woman’S Cry Is Another Woman’S Answer - Rosemary C Green</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Deep Calls Too Deep&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, Ive always felt I had a great relationship with the Lord. I was told I was a gifted child. I would hear things or see people that werent there. My grandmother Letha Mae would tell me that it was a gift from God, that he would one day use me to HELP (healing everything life presents) people. Yes, what a life to live! For that reason, I stayed close to God as I could. I lived in much fear and silence in an upside-down world that never stopped turning. The tears I shed and the rejection I witnessed became my personal testimony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt I needed to keep this a secret. In order to do so, I talked less. I would dream, and the next day, I would be walking into my dream. They sometimes dictated my day. As a child, Ive always wanted to just grow up, live my life, get married, and have children with God being the center. Im living in a world they say is normal, which seems to take me on a different path in life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The comfort I find in God is that he loves me and he cares for me and Im always on his mind. His favor follows me, and I cant do anything about it. So I choose to love him back. Knowing that he knew me before I was in my mothers womb is amazing to me. The safety of his love takes my fears away as I crawl upon his lap and let him be my God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I want you to see in my writings is that no matter what youve gone through or where youve been, he cant help but love you. We are to serve and walk in love. Its notes all the time, but it gets easier with the Lords help. It is a learned behavior to choose and do it! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remembered hearing people call out for help. Yet when I looked around, everyone would appear to be very happy. I believe then God was guiding me in a path of faith. Deliverance and healing Im experiencing now in ministry. The biggest challenge is to hear someone calling for HELP and not finding the voice that carries such pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I fasted and prayed to God for an answer for what to do with what Im hearing. The answer I got was to challenge it by praying and looking for a person. I did, and when I located who that person might have been, she tried to deny it until I sincerely, with oozing love, asked her again, How are you really doing? Then at that point, she burst into uncontrollable tears that I knew as a human being I couldnt handle within myself. God led me every step of what to do, and from then on, I cant help myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ladies, in this book alone, we choose to share our stories. What is your story? Remember, one womans cry is another womans cry. You must choose to be loved. Forgive them that wounded you. Win by losing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; And he said to them all, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me. For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: but whosoever lose his life shall for my sake shall save it (Luke 9:2324, KJV). &lt;/p&gt;" />
