  <title>The Voice of the Seven Thunders - George Kevyn Weber</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;There is no time for the people of the world to waste to decide to change their ways and their ways of living. The world is in a crisis that it has not been in before. Actually the world has been in countless crises in the past, before disaster, calamity or catastrophe struck the people of the earth.&lt;br /&gt;We are not talking of crises of natural disasters, calamities or catastrophes that have hit the earth, we are talking about man made, man engineered and man designed disasters, calamities and catastrophes that have hit the world from time to time.&lt;br /&gt;History is full of them and apart from those natural disasters caused by God or the Devil themselves; the rest were caused by man themselves. Now this revelation is not about the natural but about the spiritual.&lt;br /&gt;Power mad dictators, rulers and potentates the world over are normally the cause of these disasters, calamities and catastrophes and nature has little to do with them although they did affect nature, in some way or another.&lt;br /&gt;Small and great Wars were started by whosoever caused them without any due regard of mens lives, and the resultant horrors, hardships and horrendous pain, lived on in the hearts and lives of the people that survived. No one can add these things up nor can they count the cost in human suffering, misery and pain, nor the cost of mens souls lost all for the sake of mans vanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The current synopsis is catchy and intriguing. This synopsis is well written and it will entice readers into picking this book up and reading it.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;- Cynthia Sherman&lt;br /&gt;Writers Literary &amp; Publishing Services, Critique Division&lt;/p&gt;" />
