  <title>Faith Your Seventh-Sense - Humphrey O. Akparah</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Faith, Your Seventh-Sense
We are at our best, and we are happiest when we totally engage our Seventh-Sense toward the realization of the goals and dreams that we have set for ourselves. It gives purpose and assurance to our efforts and peace of mind to our souls. It makes life worthwhile, worth living, wonderful and fulfilled. Your FAITH is your Seventh-Sense. 
Faith is a powerful sense-ability and motivational word combined. It is a tested truth and contains principles by which any one may succeed in any endeavor depending on your own definition of success. Faith is a success button. It is such an amazing gift that so many people neglect out of ignorance.
Faith is the compass of the soul. Faith is the lifeline of all humans; without it, fear, doubt, anxiety, unbelief, sickness and failure are the alternatives. A strong faith is an antidote against stress, fear, sickness and failure. Faith is the mother of all achievements.
Living a fulfilled life would be almost impossible without a well developed faith-ability. And you cannot overcome any of your fears; whether it is the fear of failure, death, poverty, sickness, criticisms, personal insecurities, etc., until you begin to apply the principles and powers of your faith. With the added advantage of a vibrant faith-ability you stand taller in the spirit than those who only rely on the five senses.
You will discover the amazing power of your faith after reading this book. Your faith will rise to action-oriented and problem-solving levels. You will also receive a faith that potentially destroys fears, generates miracles, and changes situations. This is because faith is a developed ability and a conditioned state of mind to trust and not doubt. It is a life support and life sustainer in times of adversity. You could do more for yourself through the power of your faith than a million dollars would. You are richer than you think through faith and poorer than you imagined without it. Faith, your 7th Sense ability." />
