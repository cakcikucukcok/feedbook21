  <title>Exodus: Book on Fire - Edward Dickson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;&quot;&gt;The divine plan in Exodus was conceived by God before the creation, because Jesus was the Lamb slain before the foundation of the world. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;&quot;&gt;This is the central theme of the Bible, and if a person did not know about it, the Bible would remain a mystery. The Bible has been interpreted many ways, but if we could state the theme and central message of the Bible, then we could understand it much better. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;&quot;&gt;Exodus offers us a portion of that plan. Exodus is a story, which makes it easy to read. It is the story of redemption and salvation and of the life of Israel afterward, in which God told them what sacrifices would please Him and how to build Him a house. Our study will include explanations of those animal sacrifices and how Christ fulfilled them. This book was written to make Exodus more enjoyable and profitable in Bible study.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
