  <title>The Bleeding Island - Stephen Heynes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Now you know
	 Veluppillai Prabhakaran and his LTTE, who held sway in the modern Srilanka  are the products of certain unfortunate sociopolitical conditions which every sensible state should  fight to avoid their germination . If we do not learn from history, the history teaches us in a cruel way. 
	This is the story of  the enchanting South Asian  Island Srilanka;  Of the intelligent, enterprising, and proud Tamils of the Island; Of their  sociopolitical equation with the Sinhalese partners ;  Of the  formidable LTTE ;  and of  their fearsome,  leader  Prabhakaran who was also fearful for his life all the time. This book also tells the inside stories of LTTEs birth, growth and death. Their violence, assassinations, and why and how they killed Padmanabha, Rajiv Gandhi, Amirthalingam, Premadasa and Mahataya among many others.  The  tale of their fund raising ; their affluence; their Air Tigers; their Sea Tigers; their Black Tigers and their ultimate  downfall. Not the fall of the LTTE but of Srilankan Tamils hopes. This is also the story of brave fighters and unscrupulous leaders. Story of heroism and treachery.  
	History of mankind would not forgive us if we allow this to happen again, in any form, anywhere in earth." />
