  <title>The History of Rome (Books IX-XXVI) - Livius (Livy) Titus</title>
      <meta name="description" content="An epic endeavor by a man genuinely enamored of his native Rome, Livy&#39;s &quot;The History of Rome&quot; was originally written in 142 books spanning the entire history of the Roman people up to Livy&#39;s day in the time of Augustus in the first century BC. While this Roman historian&#39;s monumental undertaking took most of his life, only 35 books still survive today. Livy begins with Aeneas&#39; landing on Italy and the myth of Romulus and Remus&#39; founding of Rome. He also thoroughly covers numerous wars, such as the Samnite Wars, the Punic Wars, and the Social War, as well as all of the rulers of Rome, including Julius Caesar, Nero, and Augustus. Though the work is a bit biased, its countless references to other sources are a testament of Livy&#39;s attempt to create an accurate, understandable history of the Roman Kingdom, and, later, the Republic. Simultaneously a glorification of Rome and a passionate warning to future Romans, &quot;Ab Urbe Condita&quot; reflects the magnificence and ignominy, the opinions and interests, and the myths and political realities of one of history&#39;s most remarkable civilizations. In this volume you will find books IX-XXVI of Livy&#39;s &quot;Histories&quot;." />
