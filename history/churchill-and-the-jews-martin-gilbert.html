  <title>Churchill and the Jews - Martin Gilbert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;An insightful history of Churchill&#39;s lifelong commitment--both public and private--to the Jews and Zionism, and of his outspoken opposition to anti-Semitism&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Winston Churchill was a young man in 1894 when Captain Alfred Dreyfus, a Jewish officer in the French army, was convicted of treason and sent to Devil&#39;s Island. Despite the prevailing anti-Semitism in England as well as on the Continent, Churchill&#39;s position was clear: he supported Dreyfus, and condemned the prejudices that had led to his conviction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Churchill&#39;s commitment to Jewish rights, to Zionism--and ultimately to the State of Israel--never wavered. In 1922, he established on the bedrock of international law the right of Jews to emigrate to Palestine. During his meeting with David Ben-Gurion in 1960, Churchill presented the Israeli prime minister with an article he had written about Moses, praising the father of the Jewish people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drawing on a wide range of archives and private papers, speeches, newspaper coverage, and wartime correspondence, Churchill&#39;s official biographer, Sir Martin Gilbert, explores the origins, implications, and results of Churchill&#39;s determined commitment to Jewish rights, opening a window on an underappreciated and heroic aspect of the brilliant politician&#39;s life and career.&lt;/p&gt;" />
