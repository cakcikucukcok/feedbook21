  <title>Air Crash Investigations - Suicide! - The Crash of Germanwings Flight 9525 - Dirk Barreveld</title>
      <meta name="description" content="On Tuesday 24 March 2015, the Airbus A320-211 registered D-AIPX operated by Germanwings took off from Barcelona, Spain, at 09:00 with destination D端sseldorf, Germany. At 09:41, the aircraft crashed into the mountains northeast of Marseille. The investigation into the causes of the crash revealed that the co-pilot, at a moment when he was alone in the cockpit, had deliberately flown the plane into the mountains killing all 150 persons on board.  The investigation revealed also that the co-pilot was under medical treatment for depressions by several health care providers. Neither of those providers informed any aviation authority, nor any other authority about the co-pilot&#39;s mental state. No action could have been taken by the authorities and/or his employer to prevent him from flying on the day of the accident, because they were not informed about the co-pilot&#39;s mental state of mind." />
