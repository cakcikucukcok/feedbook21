  <title>War’S a Racket Too - Billy Ray Wilson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Marine General Butlers enlightenment to the American people back in the 1930s was discarded just as the many publications, Internet, and books regarding the September 11, 2001 aerial attack on the United States of America.
After General Butler, President Dwight David Eisenhower told the nation of the continuous dangers of the military-industrial complex; however, individuals like former Vice President Richard Cheney took us to war in Afghanistan and Iraq under the false threat of international terrorism.
On or about September 20, 2016, a National Geographic documentary reported the questioning of President Saddam Hussein by a designated Federal Bureau of Investigations agent. From the interview, we learned President Hussein did not have any weapons of mass destruction nor was there an association with the religious zealot Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, an Internet report, allegedly written by a minister of the British Government, cited a Pentagon PDAS stand policy for US Air Defense aircraft; whereas, allowing the hijacked airliners to proceed to their targets.
Lastly, the Royal Saudi Government was not complicit in the 9/11 attack but individuals in our own government for the sale of military logistics and removing Saddam Hussein from power, at the behest of Israel. President George W. Bush is on tape confirming how Israel demanded the removal of Saddam Hussein and the 1998 Congress passed the 1998 Iraq Liberation Act to assure said action.
