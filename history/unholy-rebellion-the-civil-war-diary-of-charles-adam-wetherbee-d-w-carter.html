  <title>Unholy Rebellion: The Civil War Diary of Charles Adam Wetherbee - D. W. Carter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;I left three years ago to do my part in  putting down this unholy rebellion.&quot;   By 1861, Charles Adam Wetherbee had officially traded his comfortable life as a college student for one that included drafty Sibley tents, long marches in weather and wilderness of all kinds, and bloodshed.   A Union infantryman with the Thirty-Fourth Illinois Volunteer Regiment, he survived the battles of Shiloh, Stones River, Liberty Gap, Atlanta, and others.   One hundred years later, long after Wetherbee had died, a tattered and faded diary was found at a home in Lawrence, Kansas. The homeowner opened its pages and was astonished to discover that Wetherbee had penned every detail of his daily life during the Civil War.   Wetherbee&#39;s diary presents a realistic view of what a soldier&#39;s life entailed, as the reader is thrust into the firsthand drama of the Civil War as it was endured by enlisted participants. Get a true sense of what the Civil War was like from someone who was there to witness an Unholy Rebellion." />
