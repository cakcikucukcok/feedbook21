  <title>The Haunting of Eveline Paine - John Robert Allen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The hurricane of 1929 devastated Miami and affected Eveline Paines plans for a new life in South Florida. Ransom letters and threats of kidnapping her sons, Patrick and Andrew, led Eveline to gangsters and situations that forced her to relive her previous life in New York State. Many individuals from her past and present had been involved in attempts to undermine her wealth that she inherited from her late husband, Wallace Paine. After attempts and threats to kill Eveline, a detective from the Miami Police Department, Jonathon Bingham, is assigned to the case and proceeds to uncover more criminal activity than expected. Eveline had believed the corruption that was exposed years ago, and put to a trial in Rochester, New York, a few years earlier, had been concluded. She is still haunted by suspicious characters and circumstances that appear to be people and events from her former life in Geneva, NY. After many months of uncertainty, situations unfold causing Eveline to learn the truth about people in her past when she and Eleanor Roosevelt share lunch at the Biltmore Hotel. After learning new information, Eveline is forced to rethink and face what had happened many years ago. Being concerned about her future now, because everyone is either dead, in prison, or moved away, Eveline suffers from a recurring ailment that has implications for her future. From The House of Many Windows and The Spirit of Wallace Paine to The Haunting of Eveline Paine, Eveline is forced to overcome unbelievable odds which ultimately give her the freedom for a new life." />
