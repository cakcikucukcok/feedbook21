  <title>For Crew and Country - John Wukovits</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;For Crew and Country&lt;/i&gt;, John Wukovits tells of the most dramatic naval battle of the Pacific War and the incredible sacrifice of the &lt;i&gt;USS Samuel B. Roberts.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On October 25, 1944, the &lt;i&gt;Samuel B. Roberts&lt;/i&gt;, along with the other twelve vessels comprising its unit, stood between Japan&#39;s largest battleship force ever sent to sea and MacArthur&#39;s transports inside Leyte Gulf. Faced with the surprise appearance of more than twenty Japanese battleships, cruisers, and destroyers, including the &lt;i&gt;Yamato&lt;/i&gt;, at 70,000 tons the most potent battlewagon in the world, the 1,200-ton &lt;i&gt;Samuel B. Roberts&lt;/i&gt; turned immediately into action with six other ships. Captain Copeland marked the occasion with one of the most poignant addresses ever given to men on the edge of battle: &quot;Men,&quot; he said over the intercom, &quot;we are about to go into a fight against overwhelming odds from which survival cannot be expected.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ship churned straight at the enemy in a near-suicidal attempt to deflect the more potent foe, allow the small aircraft carriers to escape, and buy time for MacArthur&#39;s forces. Of 563 destroyers constructed during WWII, the &lt;i&gt;Samuel B. Roberts &lt;/i&gt;was the only one sunk, going down with guns blazing in a duel reminiscent of the Spartans at Thermopylae or Davy Crockett&#39;s Alamo defenders. The men who survived faced a horrifying three-day nightmare in the sea, where they battled a lack of food and water, scorching sun and numbing nighttime cold, and nature&#39;s most feared adversary--sharks.&lt;br&gt;The battle would go down as history&#39;s greatest sea clash, the Battle of Samar--the dramatic climax of the Battle of Leyte Gulf.&lt;/p&gt;" />
