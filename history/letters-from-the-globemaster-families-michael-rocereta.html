  <title>Letters from the Globemaster Families - Michael Rocereta</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Letters from the Globemaster Families: The Lost C-124 of Mount Gannett, Alaska gathers evidence and presents the most likely description of the final flight of a United States Air Force troop transport plane carrying fifty-two servicemen. The Globemaster C-124 crashed into the side of Mount Gannett, Alaska. Sixty years later a glacier yielded up both the wreckage and remains of some of the crashs victims.
Michael Rocereta uses his two decades worth of experience as an instrument-rated private pilot, his education as a geologist and his experience investigating accidents to guide his research, presentation and conclusions regarding the accident.
Letters from the Globemaster Families uses as introductions to its chapters the correspondence of relatives as they write about their desires to know the details of the airplanes crash and their loved ones deaths. This approach provides a personal counterbalance to the technical details covered in the chapters themselves. The book concludes with a collection of short biographies of the servicemen, a glossary of terms and acronyms, a selected bibliography, and an index.
No matter whether you appreciate the work of a solid investigation, regional history of Alaska, military history, or the resolution that individuals can feel when they come to closure, then Letters from the Globemaster Families: The Lost C-124 of Mount Gannett, Alaska, will deliver a focused narrative of a tragic event that spans the decades." />
