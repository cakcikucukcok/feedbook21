  <title>Presidio of San Francisco - Bobby Bill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A Presidio of San Francisco Closure Study began after the controversial Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1988 (BRAC 88) was enacted and placed the Presidio of San Francisco on the BRAC 88 Base Closure list.  The required Presidio of San Francisco Closure Study, prepared by the Headquarters, Sixth US Army staff, tried to justify the continuance of the Presidio Post.  This study continued for several years but eventually was ineffective bowing to political and military pressure and interference.  
This Case Study complements the Presidio of San Francisco Closure Study that overlaps the same time period that planned and programmed a systematic process where both management theory and assumptions could be applied to justify improvements in management competence, organizational improvements, and cost effectiveness.  This Case Study contains a chronological history of events at the Presidio of San Francisco, and reviews a crisis precipitated by the Department of Defense (DOD) action under a Congressional mandate for Post and Base closures. 
This caused an administrative dilemma while concurrently, trying to plan the realignment of the Headquarters, Sixth US Army staff; discontinuance of the Presidio Garrison; closing the Presidio of San Francisco as a US Army military Installation; and transferring the Presidio Post operations, repair, and maintenance activities to the US National Park Service." />
