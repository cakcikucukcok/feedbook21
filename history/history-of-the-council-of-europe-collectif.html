  <title>History of the Council of Europe - Collectif</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Council of Europe, the oldest European  organisation, was founded in 1949 with the aim of unifying the continent as a  whole. The decision to establish its headquarters in Strasbourg was, moreover,  symbolic of the desire for reconciliation between peoples. From the outset the  Council of Europe adopted an institutional structure comprising a committee of  ministers and a parliamentary assembly - the first in Europe. This book retraces  the history of the Organisation.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Consisting  initially of Western European states, the Council of Europe was destined to  embrace all the continent&#39;s countries, but the Cold War delayed its enlargement.  It is only since 1989 that the Council of Europe has become a truly pan-European  organisation, now comprising 47 member states.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Its mission is based on  three major goals: protecting human rights, promoting democratic values and  guaranteeing the rule of law. The Council of Europe is also very active in  fostering co-operation in all areas of life: education, sport, culture, etc.  Starting in 1959, the European Court of Human Rights grew to become the  Organisation&#39;s flagship institution: its judgments are binding on the member  states.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
As an intergovernmental organisation, the Council of Europe has  had to contend with the growth of the European Union and has sought constantly  to redefine its role in international relations. In these early years of the  21st century, will it succeed in securing a key position in the European  institutional architecture?&lt;/p&gt;" />
