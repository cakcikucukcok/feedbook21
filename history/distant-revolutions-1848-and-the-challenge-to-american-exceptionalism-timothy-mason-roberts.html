  <title>Distant Revolutions: 1848 and the Challenge to American Exceptionalism - Timothy Mason Roberts</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;Distant Revolutions: 1848 and the Challenge to American     Exceptionalism&lt;/i&gt; is a study of American politics, culture, and foreign relations in the     mid-nineteenth century, illuminated through the reactions of Americans to the European     revolutions of 1848. Flush from the recent American military victory over Mexico, many Americans     celebrated news of democratic revolutions breaking out across Europe as a further sign of divine     providence. Others thought that the 1848 revolutions served only to highlight how     America&#39;s own revolution had not done enough in the way of reform. Still other Americans     renounced the 1848 revolutions and the thought of trans-atlantic unity because they interpreted     European revolutionary radicalism and its portents of violence, socialism, and atheism as     dangerous to the unique virtues of the United States.&lt;p&gt;When the 1848 revolutions failed     to create stable democratic governments in Europe, many Americans declared that their own     revolutionary tradition was superior; American reform would be gradual and peaceful. Thus, when     violence erupted over the question of territorial slavery in the 1850s, the effect was magnified     among antislavery Americans, who reinterpreted the menace of slavery in light of the revolutions     and counter-revolutions of Europe. For them a new revolution in America could indeed be     necessary, to stop the onset of authoritarian conditions and to cure American exemplarism. The     Civil War, then, when it came, was America&#39;s answer to the 1848 revolutions, a testimony     to America&#39;s democratic shortcomings, and an American version of a violent,     nation-building revolution.&lt;/p&gt;" />
