  <title>Reconstructing the Campus: Higher Education and the American Civil War - Michael David Cohen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Civil War transformed American life. Not only did thousands of men     die on battlefields and millions of slaves become free; cultural institutions reshaped     themselves in the context of the war and its aftermath. The first book to examine the Civil     War&#39;s immediate and long-term impact on higher education, &lt;i&gt;Reconstructing the     Campus &lt;/i&gt;begins by tracing college communities&#39; responses to the secession crisis     and the outbreak of war. Students made supplies for the armies or left campus to fight.     Professors joined the war effort or struggled to keep colleges open. The Union and Confederacy     even took over some campuses for military use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then moving beyond 1865, the     book explores the war&#39;s long-term effects on colleges. Michael David Cohen argues that the     Civil War and the political and social conditions the war created prompted major reforms,     including the establishment of a new federal role in education. Reminded by the war of the     importance of a well-trained military, Congress began providing resources to colleges that     offered military courses and other practical curricula. Congress also, as part of a general     expansion of the federal bureaucracy that accompanied the war, created the Department of     Education to collect and publish data on education. For the first time, the U.S. government both     influenced curricula and monitored institutions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The war     posed special challenges to Southern colleges. Often bereft of students and sometimes physically     damaged, they needed to rebuild. Some took the opportunity to redesign themselves into the first     Southern universities. They also admitted new types of students, including the poor, women, and,     sometimes, formerly enslaved blacks. Thus, while the Civil War did great harm, it also     stimulated growth, helping, especially in the South, to create our modern system of higher     education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
