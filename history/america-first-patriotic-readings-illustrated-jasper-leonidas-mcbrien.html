  <title>America First: Patriotic Readings (Illustrated) - Jasper Leonidas McBrien </title>
      <meta name="description" content="America First was the central thought in President Wilson&amp;rsquo;s address&lt;br /&gt;
to the Daughters of the American Revolution on the twenty-fifth&lt;br /&gt;
anniversary of their organization&amp;mdash;their Silver Jubilee&amp;mdash;in&lt;br /&gt;
Washington, D. C., October 11, 1915. The president declared in this&lt;br /&gt;
address that all citizens should make it plain whether their&lt;br /&gt;
sympathies for foreign countries come before their love of the United&lt;br /&gt;
States, or whether they are for America first, last, and all the time. He&lt;br /&gt;
asserted, also, that our people need all of their patriotism in this&lt;br /&gt;
confusion of tongues in which we find ourselves over the European&lt;br /&gt;
war.&lt;br /&gt;
The press throughout the country has taken up the thought of the&lt;br /&gt;
President and, seconded by the efforts of the Bureau of Education,&lt;br /&gt;
has done loyal work in making &amp;ldquo;America First&amp;rdquo; our national slogan.&lt;br /&gt;
This is all good so far as it goes&amp;mdash;especially among the adult&lt;br /&gt;
population, many of whom must be educated, if educated at all, on&lt;br /&gt;
the run. But the rising generation, both native-born and foreign, to&lt;br /&gt;
get the full meaning of this slogan in its far-reaching significance,&lt;br /&gt;
must have time for study and reflection along patriotic lines. There&lt;br /&gt;
must be the right material on which the American youth may settle&lt;br /&gt;
their thoughts for a definite end in patriotism if our country is to&lt;br /&gt;
have a new birth of freedom and if &amp;ldquo;this government of the people,&lt;br /&gt;
by the people, and for the people is not to perish from the earth.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
The prime and vital service of amalgamating into one homogeneous&lt;br /&gt;
body the children alike of those who are born here and of those who&lt;br /&gt;
come here from so many different lands must be rendered this&lt;br /&gt;
Republic by the school teachers of America.&lt;br /&gt;
The purpose of this book is to furnish the teachers and pupils of our&lt;br /&gt;
country, material with which the idea of true Americanism may be&lt;br /&gt;
developed until &amp;ldquo;America First&amp;rdquo; shall become the slogan of every&lt;br /&gt;
man, woman, and child in the United States." />
