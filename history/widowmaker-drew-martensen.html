  <title>Widowmaker - Drew Martensen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is the most poignant Vietnam War book I have read and without any selfbravado. It ranks up there with the famous WWI trench books. One could never again glorify war after reading this book. &lt;br&gt;
                              Hugo Trux, Marketing Director &lt;p&gt;
I half-heartedly picked up Widowmaker one day and was quickly immersed into one of the most riveting real life adventures I have ever read. The Honorable Jon Spahr, JD, Licking County Court, Ohio &lt;p&gt;
I reluctantly picked up Widowmaker one day and couldnt put it down. This is the best book I have ever read and believe it would make a great movie. Jim Shulman, PhD, CEO (retired) &lt;p&gt;
I usually dont have time to read novels; however, I picked up Widowmaker and completed reading it in eight hours. It has been extremely helpful in my practice with treating PTSD and is one of the best books I have ever read. Judith Box, MD,
Psychiatrist &lt;p&gt;
I was 7 years old when my brother served in Vietnam. Thirty years later, he still has never spoken a word about Vietnam. After reading Widowmaker, I understood his silence. Drews book profoundly affected me and I have read it several times. Carol Bennett" />
