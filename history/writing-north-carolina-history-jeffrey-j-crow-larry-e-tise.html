  <title>Writing North Carolina History - Jeffrey J. Crow, Larry E. Tise</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;Writing North Carolina History&lt;/i&gt; is the first book to assess fully the historical literature of North Carolina.  It combines the talents and insights of eight noted scholars of state and southern history:  William S. Powell, Alan D. Watson, Robert M. Calhoon, Harry L. Watson, Sarah M. Lemmon, and H. G. Jones. Their essays are arranged in chronological order from the founding of the first English colony in North America in 1585 to the present.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Traditionally North Carolina has not received the same scholarly attention as Virginia and South Carolina, despite the excellent resources available on Tar Heel history.  This study, derived from a symposium sponsored by the North Carolina Division of Archives and History in 1977, asks questions and describes methodologies needed to redress past neglect.  Besides providing a comprehensive evaluation of what has been written about North Carolina, the essayists offer perspectives on how historians have interpreted the state&#39;s history and what directions future historians need to take.  Particularly important, the book provides a bibliography and suggests opportunities for future historical investigation by discussing topics, themes, and source materials that remain untapped or underused.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;North Carolina&#39;s unique and colorful culture, folklore, geography, politics, and growth demand new and creative historical analysis.  Collectively the authors and editors of &lt;i&gt;Writing North Carolina History&lt;/i&gt; offer a welcome, necessary guide to the study of Tar Heel history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Originally published in 1979.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A UNC Press Enduring Edition -- UNC Press Enduring Editions use the latest in digital technology to make available again books from our distinguished backlist that were previously out of print. These editions are published unaltered from the original, and are presented in affordable paperback formats, bringing readers both historical and cultural value.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
