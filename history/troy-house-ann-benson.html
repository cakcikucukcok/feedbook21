  <title>Troy House - Ann Benson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The architectural history of Troy House in Monmouthshire is positioned at the centre of this extensive new research volume, to support a consideration of how the surrounding land was refashioned over time. Investigating the estate’s main components, first individually and then by cross-referencing the findings, extends our current understanding of them as discreet and at the same time interrelating entities. Previously unrecorded historical features are discovered that belong to the house and its landscape, and comprehensive evidence is applied to challenge current understandings. The house and its pleasure gardens, the walled garden, the farm and the surrounding parkland are demonstrated together by this research to be a rare surviving example, in Wales especially, of a complete Tudor estate with Jacobean and Carolean aggrandisement. As such, Troy House occupies a significant place in history." />
