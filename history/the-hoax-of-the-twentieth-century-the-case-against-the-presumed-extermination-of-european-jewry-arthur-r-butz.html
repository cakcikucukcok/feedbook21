  <title>The Hoax of the Twentieth Century: The Case Against the Presumed Extermination of European Jewry - Arthur R. Butz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;On 545 pages of penetrating study and lucid commentary, Dr. Butz gives the reader a graduate course on the subject of the Jews of World War Two Europe. One main focus is on Auschwitz, which during WWII was a strategically important location of German petrochemistry. Information about this location had been available to the Allies for a long time. The fact that the claimed exterminations had to be known to the Allies but obviously were unknow to them, has always been sheer inexplicable for experts in the field. Except if those exterminations simply didn&amp;rsquo;t happen &amp;ndash; and this is exactly Prof. Dr. Butz&amp;rsquo;s approach.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Chapter by solidly referenced chapter, Dr. Butz applies the scientist&amp;#39;s rigorous clinical technique to every cornerstone of the legend. He focuses on the post-war crimes trials where the prosecution&amp;#39;s false evidence was secured by coercion and even torture. He re-examines the very German records so long misrepresented; he critiques the European demographics, which do not allow for the loss of the Six Million; he re-evaluates the concept and technical feasibility of the gas chambers with some startling conclusions; and he separates the cold facts from the sheer tonnage of disinformation that has served as a formidable barrier to the truth since the end of WWII.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The first edition of this book caused unprecedented shockwaves throughout the academic and political world in the 1970s. Its open sale has been banned in an increasing number of countries including Germany and Canada. It is a book violently denounced by those unable to refute its thesis &amp;ndash; the most hysterical reactions to it coming from those whose own historical views cannot withstand the light of honest review.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now in its fourth edition, five major supplements have been updated to bring the reader up-to-date on the continuing Holocaust controversy and its impact almost everywhere World War Two is discussed. A best-seller by any meaningful standard, yet still ignored and maligned by the people who have known of it but have never even made the effort to read it, &lt;em&gt;The Hoax of the Twentieth Century&lt;/em&gt; is a book you must read if you want a clear picture of the scope and magnitude of the historical cover-up of our age, who is behind it, and what can be done to put an end to it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We have known about it [&lt;em&gt;The Hoax of the Twentieth Century&lt;/em&gt;] for some time. But we didn&amp;#39;t want to give it any publicity and help the sales. Now it&amp;#39;s too late; it&amp;#39;s out in the open and we have to face it squarely.&amp;quot;&amp;mdash;Abbot A. Rosen, Chicago Executive Director, ADL, &lt;em&gt;Pittsburgh Press&lt;/em&gt;, Jan. 26, 1977&lt;/p&gt;" />
