  <title>Lady Wears a Star - Steven Douglas Glover</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;1880 Paris, Texas sat on the edge of one of the most dangerous territories of the Old West.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a young girl, Lydia Forsyth loses her best friend when their family is robbed and murdered by three vicious men.  After committing outrages against the family, the trio escapes to safety into the Indian Territory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comforted by her loving parents, Lydia vows to learn the gun for protection.  Following the loss of her mother, she travels the Indian Territory with her mercantile sales representative father.  She becomes familiar with Choctaw culture as well as gaining an understanding of the dangers of camping in the wilds of the Territory.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, Lydia boards at a finishing school in Dallas.  Upon graduation, she returns to Paris, Texas where she seeks to become a Deputy U.S. Marshal for the Southern Indian Territory.  The attractive, skilled horsewoman is an expert marksman who always rides with Colt Revolver on her hip and a Winchester on the saddle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This historical novel of the Old West is brimming with suspense, humor, and the personal relationships of a passionate young woman who becomes one of the select few women to wear the Star of a Deputy U.S. Marshal and ride the Indian Territory serving justice.&lt;/p&gt;" />
