  <title>Revisioning: Critical Methods of Seeing Christianity in the History of Art - James Romaine, Linda Stratford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ReVisioning: Critical Methods of Seeing Christianity in the History of Art examines the application of art historical methods to the history of Christianity and art. As methods of art history have become more interdisciplinary, there has been a notable emergence of discussions of religion in art history as well as related fields such as visual culture and theology. This book represents the first critical examination of scholarly methodologies applied to the study of Christian subjects, themes, and contexts in art.   ReVisioning contains original work from a range of scholars, each of whom has addressed the question, in regard to a well-known work of art or body of work, How have particular methods of art history been applied, and with what effect? The study moves from the third century to the present, providing extensive treatment and analysis of art historical methods applied to the history of Christianity and art." />
