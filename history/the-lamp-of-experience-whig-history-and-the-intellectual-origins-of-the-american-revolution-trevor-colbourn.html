  <title>The Lamp of Experience: Whig History and the Intellectual Origins of the American Revolution - Trevor Colbourn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;P&gt;In a landmark work, a leading scholar of the eighteenth century examines the ways in which an understanding of the nature of history influenced the thinking of the founding fathers.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;As Jack P. Greene has observed, &quot;[The Whig] conception saw the past as a continual struggle between liberty and virtue on one hand and arbitrary power and corruption on the other.&quot; Many founders found in this intellectual tradition what Josiah Quincy, Jr., called the &quot;true old English liberty,&quot; and it was this Whig tradition&amp;#8212;this conception of liberty&amp;#8212;that the champions of American independence and crafters of the new republic sought to perpetuate. Colbourn supports his thesis&amp;#8212;that &quot;Independence was in large measure the product of the historical concepts of the men who made it&quot;&amp;#8212;by documenting what books were read most widely by the founding generation. He also cites diaries, personal correspondence, newspapers, and legislative records.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Trevor Colbourn&lt;/B&gt; is President Emeritus of the University of Central Florida.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
