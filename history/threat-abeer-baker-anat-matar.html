  <title>Threat - Abeer Baker, Anat Matar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Palestinian prisoners charged with security-related offences are immediately taken as a threat to Israel&#39;s security. They are seen as potential, if not actual, suicide bombers. This stereotype ignores the political nature of the Palestinian prisoners&#39; actions and their desire for liberty. 
By highlighting the various images of Palestinian prisoners in the Israel-Palestine conflict, Abeer Baker and Anat Matar chart their changing fortunes. Essays written by prisoners, ex-prisoners, Human rights defenders, lawyers and academic researchers analyse the political nature of imprisonment and Israeli attitudes towards Palestinian prisoners. These contributions deal with the prisoners&#39; status within Palestinian society, the conditions of their imprisonment and various legal procedures used by the Israeli military courts in order to criminalise and de-politicise them. Also addressed are Israel&#39;s breaches of international treaties in its treatment of the Palestinian prisoners, practices of torture and solitary confinement, exchange deals and prospects for release.  
This is a unique intervention within Middle East studies that will inspire those working in human rights, international law and the peace process." />
