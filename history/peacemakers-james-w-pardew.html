  <title>Peacemakers - James W. Pardew</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;The wars that accompanied the breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s were the deadliest European conflicts since World War II. The violence escalated to the point of genocide when, over the course of ten days in July 1995, Serbian troops under the command of General Ratko Mladic murdered 8,000 unarmed men and boys who had sought refuge at a UN safe-haven in Srebrenica. Shocked, the United States quickly launched a diplomatic intervention supported by military force that ultimately brought peace to the new nations created when Yugoslavia disintegrated. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt; &lt;I&gt;Peacemakers&lt;/I&gt; is the first inclusive history of the successful multilateral intervention in the Balkans from 1995--2008 by an official directly involved in the diplomatic and military responses to the crises. A deadly accident near Sarajevo in 1995 thrust James Pardew into the center of efforts to stop the fighting in Bosnia. In a detailed narrative, he shows how Richard Holbrooke and the US envoys who followed him helped to stop or prevent vicious wars in Bosnia, Croatia, Kosovo, and Macedonia. Pardew describes the human drama of diplomacy and war, illuminating the motives, character, talents, and weaknesses of the national leaders involved.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Pardew demonstrates that the use of US power to relieve human suffering is a natural fit with American values.  &lt;I&gt;Peacemakers &lt;/I&gt;serves as a potent reminder that American leadership and multilateral cooperation are often critical to resolving international crises.&lt;/P&gt;" />
