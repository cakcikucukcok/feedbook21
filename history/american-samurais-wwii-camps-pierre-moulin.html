  <title>American Samurais - Wwii Camps - Pierre Moulin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book published first under &lt;strong&gt;Dachau, Holocaust and US Samurais&lt;/strong&gt; was made to keep alive this page of inhumanity of the History of the World that should not be forgotten and may interest those who lived through the tragedy and their descent or those who are interested in WWII real history. Without concessions &lt;strong&gt;American Samurais WWII Camps&lt;/strong&gt; is not only informative but is also a memoriam for those who suffered, lived, and died under the Nazi regime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;American Samurais WWII Camps&lt;/strong&gt; is the third volume dedicated to the Nisei Soldiers, following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;American Samurais-WWII in Europe&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most decorated unit in all American History&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 100&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;/442&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; Regimental Combat Team (Socrates Institute Press-Hawaii)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;American Samurais WWII in the Pacific&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Best Kept Secret Weapon in WWII&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Military Intelligence Service (Socrates Institute Press-Hawaii)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;American Samurais WWII Camps&lt;/strong&gt; recalls the horrors of the Holocaust focusing specifically on the Dachau Camp, the first built by the Nazis in 1933. The prologue gives a general overview of the events surrounding the World War II. Next are the basic information about the camp itself with its layout and the different staffs who ran Dachau. The readers will find documentation of the rules of the camp with firsthand accounts of what happened to some of the prisoners. The Author is not afraid to speak of the atrocities committed by the Nazis. Disease, torture and death are rampant in the chilling pictures of the death chambers, ovens, and torture devices which lend credence of what was written concerning the unspeakable treatment of the Dachau inmates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day life and the working conditions in the camp and in the commandos are described without fear. Then come the last days of Dachau and how the International Liberation Committee was formed and its key role in the liberation. A chapter is devoted to the infamous death march during which the prisoners unable to walk were either shot or torn apart by the S.S. dogs. Then &lt;strong&gt;for the first time&lt;/strong&gt;, the role played bu very special liberators coming from 10 Concentration Camps in the USA: &lt;strong&gt;The American Samurais of the 522&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; Field Artillery&lt;/strong&gt; and the story of the liberation of the camp. But the story of Dachau alone wont tell the reality of the Holocaust. Next is the account of the Final Solution of the Jewish Problem with its horrible statistics. Aided by many personal quotes of Holocaust survivors and hundred of pictures, the terror of the Final Solution seems to have been meticulously documented, To be complete, the story ended with the survivors of the Holocaust, the Righteous Among the Nations (The non-Jews who saved the Jewish people) and &lt;strong&gt;for the first time&lt;/strong&gt; the Visas for Life, story of the diplomats who saved Jews during World War II.&lt;/p&gt;" />
