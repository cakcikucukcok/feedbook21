  <title>Khartoum at Night - Marie Grace Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the first half of the twentieth century, a pioneering generation of young women exited their homes and entered public space, marking a new era for women&#39;s civic participation in northern Sudan. A provocative new public presence, women&#39;s civic engagement was at its core a bodily experience. Amid the socio-political upheavals of imperial rule, female students, medical workers, and activists used a careful choreography of body movements and fashion to adapt to imperial mores, claim opportunities for political agency, and shape a new standard of modern, mobile womanhood.
&lt;i&gt;Khartoum at Night&lt;/i&gt; is the first English-language history of these women&#39;s lives, examining how their experiences of the British Empire from 1900–1956 were expressed on and through their bodies. Central to this story is the &lt;i&gt;tobe&lt;/i&gt;: a popular, modest form of dress that wrapped around a woman&#39;s head and body. Marie Grace Brown shows how northern Sudanese women manipulated the tucks, folds, and social messages of the &lt;i&gt;tobe&lt;/i&gt; to deftly negotiate the competing pulls of modernization and cultural authenticity that defined much of the imperial experience. Her analysis weaves together the threads of women&#39;s education and activism, medical midwifery, urban life, consumption, and new behaviors of dress and beauty to reconstruct the worlds of politics and pleasure in which early-twentieth-century Sudanese women lived." />

A provocative new public presence, women's civic engagement was at its core a bodily experience. Amid the socio-political upheavals of imperial rule, female students, medical workers, and activists used a careful choreography of body movements and fashion to adapt to imperial mores, claim opportunities for political agency, and shape a new standard of modern, mobile womanhood. <i>Khartoum at Night</i> is the first English-language history of these women's lives, examining how their experiences of the British Empire from 1900–1956 were expressed on and through their bodies. Central to this story is the <i>tobe</i>: a popular, modest form of dress that wrapped around a woman's head and body. Marie Grace Brown shows how northern Sudanese women manipulated the tucks, folds, and social messages of the <i>tobe</i> to deftly negotiate the competing pulls of modernization and cultural authenticity that defined much of the imperial experience.
