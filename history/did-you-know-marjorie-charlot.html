  <title>Did You Know? - Marjorie Charlot</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Did You Know?Over One Hundred Facts about Haiti and Her Children looks in detail at a land and its people, uncovering the history, culture, challenges, and achievements of a country often stereotyped as deeply impoverished and bereft of any nobility of purpose. Tapping into her expertise in research and her familiarity with the wealth of resources residing in libraries, Marjorie Charlot, a supervisor and instructor at academic libraries, has gathered, curated, and prepared a topically organized collection of vignettes depicting Haiti and her children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did You Know? presents these vignettes in chapters organized according to themes, including such topics as the Africans, art and culture, civil rights, great families, inventors, the military, pilots, religion, and science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did You Know?Over One Hundred Facts about Haiti and Her Children offers its guidance to an abundance of information about the Haitian people and their homeland. If you claim a place for Haiti in your own history, if you find yourself intrigued by the history of Haiti, or if you simply are one of those people with a deep hunger to learn more about the world, then&lt;/br&gt;
Did You Know? will provide you with an approachable and informative introduction to Haiti and her children.&lt;/p&gt;" />
