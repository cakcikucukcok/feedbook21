  <title>The Messenger - Claude L. Chafin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;In 1892, at the age of six, Andrew Lee Chafin went to live with Anderson &amp;ldquo;Devil Anse&amp;rdquo; Hatfield in order to attend school. His life would never be the same.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Hatfield-McCoy feud had been over for four years, but that didn&amp;rsquo;t stop bounty hunters and state officials from trying to hunt down Devil Anse&amp;rsquo;s sons, Cap and Johnse, to punish them for the roles they played during the course of the fighting.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
From the age of nine, Andrew Chafin&amp;mdash;author Claude Chafin&amp;rsquo;s grandfather&amp;mdash;served as the link between the elder Hatfield and his sons. Despite the danger, he delivered food and messages back and forth through the rugged mountains on horseback. He encountered bears, wildcats, and bounty hunters, but he never wavered in seeking to carry out his mission. Until now, his story&amp;mdash;that of a remarkable young man&amp;mdash;has gone untold.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Join Claude Chafin as he traces his family&amp;rsquo;s history and explores the critical role his grandfather played in the history of the famous feuding clans.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
