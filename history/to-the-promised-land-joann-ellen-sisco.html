 FROM GUNSHOT TO HOMESTEAD is book one of an eight book series, DEEP FORK RIVER, OKLAHOMA TERRITORY.
This series took place in a unique period of history when new land was deeded on the basis of a gunshot and a footrace.  The central nugget of land in the Oklahoma Territory was advertised for settlement, quarter sections were marked out and on the 22 of April, l889 the local Cavalry and other officials started the race at the shot of a gun.  The small town fictional town of Prosper was settled by these immigrants and others.  It is generally thought that this incident was the only one of its kind in history.
Book one.  FROM GUNSHOT TO HOMKESTEAD.  A 22 year old young lady and her father make a night flight to protect a small girl from kidnap.
Book two.  UNDER THE REDBUDS.  An idea born in a Nebraska storm gives birth to a snowball of activity for half a town.
Book three. TREK THROUGH THE WILDERNESS.  A young Kentucky preacher follows a strange guide with the help of a young lady.
Book four.  OF BOOMERS AND SOONERS.  Free land was passed out, but some of it was already occupied.  
Book six.  BEHIND EVERY CLOUD.  Young victim of circumstances feels she finally deserves a silver lining, if she can just turn that cloud around.
Book seven.  TO THE PROMISED LAND.  Young Camille experiences what no girl experience, but some things happen in the best families.
Book eight.  WITH A SONG IN THE NIGHT.  Two young girls who never met are thrown together in desperate circumstances." />
