  <title>Shakespeare&#39;s Pub - Pete Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A history of Britain told through the story of one very special pub, from &quot;The Beer Drinker&#39;s Bill Bryson&quot; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;(Times Literary Supplement)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;Welcome to the George Inn near London Bridge; a cosy, wood-paneled, galleried coaching house a few minutes&#39; walk from the Thames. Grab yourself a pint, listen to the chatter of the locals and lean back, resting your head against the wall. And then consider this: who else has rested their head against that wall, over the last six hundred years?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chaucer and his fellow pilgrims almost certainly drank in the George on their way out of London to Canterbury. It&#39;s fair to say that Shakespeare popped in from the nearby Globe for a pint, and we know that Dickens certainly did. Mail carriers changed their horses here, before heading to all four corners of Britain--while sailors drank here before visiting all four corners of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pub, as Pete Brown points out, is the &#39;primordial cell of British life&#39; and in the George he has found the perfect example. All life is here, from murderers, highwaymen, and ladies of the night to gossiping peddlers and hard-working clerks. So sit back with &lt;i&gt;Shakespeare&#39;s Pub&lt;/i&gt; and watch as buildings rise and fall over the centuries, and &#39;the beer drinker&#39;s Bill Bryson&#39; (UK&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Times Literary Supplement&lt;/i&gt;) takes us on an entertaining tour through six centuries of history, through the stories of everyone that ever drank in one pub.&lt;/p&gt;" />
