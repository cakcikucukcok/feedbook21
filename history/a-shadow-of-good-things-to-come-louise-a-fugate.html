  <title>A Shadow of Good Things to Come - Louise A. Fugate</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;An excellent book for anyone who is seeking to know more about the living God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first book in a two-part series, A Shadow of Good Things to Come, is a colorful book of Jewish history , dating from the time of creation with the Ancient of Days to king David. You will learn that God had a plan to save mankind, and He implemented that plan through the Jewish nation. Told in Bible-story form, you will find answers to many questions you may have about the Bible and mans relationship with God, questions such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Who is the true living God?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;What is the purpose of man?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;What promises did God give Abraham and his descendants through Isaac?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Why and how did God choose the nation of Israel to be His people?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Why and how did God set up the law and sacrificial system?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Why is Jesus called the Son of David?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deeper Insight study questions are provided at the end of each chapter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always wondered why a loving God would bring so much death and annihilation to people in the Old Testament. Now I understand. Sin was rampant, and evil men threatened the very existence of the future seed of Abraham, through whom Christ, the Savior of mankind, would come. This is a wonderful Bible-based, simply-stated study that all Christians will enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frances Henderson&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a good book for Christians who want to learn, in detail, about the twelve Tribes of Israel and their lineage leading to the birth of Christ. I was amazed to scripturally learn about the division of the land God gave to the Israelites. If you ever had doubts about Jesus, you wont anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
