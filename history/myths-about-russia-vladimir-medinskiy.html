  <title>Myths about Russia - Vladimir Medinskiy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Russia&#39;s rich history is full of secrets: there&#39;s not another country in the world with so many skeletons in its closet. Vladimir Medinskiy&#39;s new book offers the reader the opportunity to get better acquainted with some myths about Russia in an quick, easy and entertaining way.  The book covers some of the most interesting, colourful and controversial debates in Russian history and the most popular myths about Russia: vodka and its role in some incredible adventures, Russia&#39;s problems (apart from the roads and having too many fools), some lessons from the Bastille and the Civil War, the last testament of Peter the Great, amongst many others. In his book the author tackles some of the most pressing questions about Russia: whether you can trust Russians, the meaning of progress in Russian terms, who really won at the Battle of Borodino two hundred years ago, why Russians call Napoleon &#39;the consummate liar&#39;, and also whether Russians are the true originators of petrol, mobile phones and the cinema.  Myths About Russia is Medinskiy&#39;s original and humorous take on the subject: in this book, he diligently unravels the myths surrounding this vast and complex nation, picking them apart to uncover the truth about Russia and her fascinating history.   Vladimir Medinskiy is a Russian statesman, professor, essayist and novelist. Since May 2012 he has held the post of Minister of Culture of the Russian Federation. Although he is the author of several popular books on advertising, PR and history, his Myths About Russia series is Medinskiy&#39;s most famous, having been the bestselling Russian popular history series of recent years. In 2012 he published his first work of fiction, The Wall, which critics have called one of the best examples of the revival of the historical novel in Russia today.  Medinskiy studied at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations and graduated with honours from the Faculty of International Journalism. During his university years, he also participated in the activities of student journalist associations, worked as a press service intern at the Soviet (and then Russian) Embassy in Washington, D.C. From 1992 to 1998 he was head of the PR agency Ya Corporation.  After gaining his degree at the Moscow State Institute in 1997, Vladimir Medinskiy began his teaching career in the university&#39;s Faculty of Journalism. He gained his doctorate in 1999 and since then has taught as a professor at the same university.  From 2010 to its liquidation in 2012, Medinskiy was appointed as a member of the Presidential Commission to Counter Attempts to Falsify History to the Detriment of Russia&#39;s Interests. In July 2011, he became a member of the board of the Russkiy Mir Foundation, which aims to promote Russian language and culture through various programs internationally." />
