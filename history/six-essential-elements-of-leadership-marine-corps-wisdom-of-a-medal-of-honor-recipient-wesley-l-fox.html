  <title>Six Essential Elements of Leadership: Marine Corps Wisdom of a Medal of Honor Recipient - Wesley  L. Fox</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Col. Wesley Fox is a Medal of Honor recipient who wrote two widely respected accounts of his wartime experiences in the Marine Corps. His books, &lt;I&gt;Marine Rifleman: Forty-Three Years in the Corps&lt;/I&gt; and &lt;I&gt;Courage and Fear: A Primer&lt;/I&gt;, are both considered classic war memoirs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Drawing on over four decades of leadership experience, both during two wars and peacetime, Fox insists that a good leader must focus on building an organization based on the bonds of comradeship. Successful leaders are those who are actively concerned with the health, happiness, and daily lives of those who follow them. He contends that those who have such leaders will be better prepared to cope with any challenge because they are part of a group built on loyalty and trust.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; Fox defines the six essential elements of successful leadership as care, personality, knowledge, motivation, commitment, and communication. He presents a chapter on each element, recounts how his views of leadership were forged, and offers impressive examples of leadership displayed by his fellow Marines. While drawn directly from his military experience, Fox contends that these six elements apply to all who want to pursue effective leadership. His book is certain to inspire and motivate both civilians and members of the military.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
