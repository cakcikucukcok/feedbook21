  <title>Allied Master Strategists: The Combined Chiefs of Staff in World War II - David Rigby</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Calling the Combined Chiefs of Staff the glue that held the British-American alliance together in World War II, David Rigby describes the vital contributions to Allied victory made by the organization, which drew its members from the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, the British Chiefs of Staff Committee, and the British Joint Staff Mission. Readers get a good understanding of the personalities involved and insights into the relationships between the Chiefs and Allied theater commanders. The role of the Combined Chiefs in economic mobilization and the bitter inter-Allied strategic debates are fully examined. Detailed information is also given about the Casablanca Conference and the Chiefs&amp;#8217; often highly contentious meetings in Washington. The book gives the Combined Chiefs what they have long deserved&amp;#151;a book not weighted towards the Americans or the British and not strictly naval, army, or air oriented, but combined in an international as well as an inter-service manner.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
