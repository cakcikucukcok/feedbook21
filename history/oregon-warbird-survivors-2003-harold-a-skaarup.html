  <title>Oregon Warbird Survivors 2003 - Harold A. Skaarup</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Some of the finest military warbirds in American aviation history are still flying in the West Coast State of Oregon. Many of them are on display in a number of excellent air museums, or they have been mounted on pylons to stand as memorials to the many military aviators who called Oregon home.  This handbook is designed to provide aviation enthusiasts with a simple locating guide on where to find a good number of these incredible flying machines within the state.  Many of the aircraft can be found in the Tillamook Naval Air Station Museum; the Evergreen Aviation Museum at McMinnville; in the Oregon Air &amp; Space Museum at Eugene; with the Oregon Military Museum at Clackmas; or in the hands of private owners and collectors.  The handbook provides photographs of many of the aircraft preserved in Oregon, along with a brief description and history of its service within the US armed forces.  The aircraft are listed alphabetically by manufacturer, number and aircraft type. Famous aircraft found on display in Oregon include the gigantic Hughes HK-1 Flying Boat (also known as the Spruce Goose), and a number of very rare warbirds not found in many other museums." />
