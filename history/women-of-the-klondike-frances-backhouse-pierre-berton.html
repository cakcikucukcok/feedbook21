  <title>Women of the Klondike - Frances Backhouse, Pierre Berton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Discover the compelling stories of the brave and adventurous women whose lives were forever changed by the Klondike gold rush. When the steamship Portland docked in Seattle&#39;s harbour in 1897, a group of scruffy men and women walked down the gangplank. There was nothing remarkable about them, except they were dragging sacks stuffed with half a million dollars? worth of gold. Among them was Ethel Berry, who helped mine one of the richest claims in the Klondike. Compared to the tens of thousands of men, the number of women who joined the stampede was never high, but their impact was immense. They were miners, entrepreneurs, teachers, doctors, nurses, journalists, entertainers, missionaries, and mothers. Using diaries, letters, memoirs, newspaper accounts, and more than 50 archival photographs, Backhouse has carefully researched the stories of these women and provided us with intimate and intriguing portraits. After Women of the Klondike was first published in 1995 it quickly became a Canadian bestseller. Now, over fifteen years later, the stories of these women continue to fascinate and entertain us in this electronic edition. This edition also features user-friendly hyperlinked cross-references and footnotes." />
