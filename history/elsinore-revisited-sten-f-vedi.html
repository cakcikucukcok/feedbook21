  <title>Elsinore Revisited - Sten F. Vedi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book challenges the general assumption that William Shakespeare was the sole author of Hamlet. It is maintained that the plot line and the characters were drawn up by someone else. This someone is thought to have been a person of high rank, a feudal prince, in the Elizabethan society. Being a nobleman whose constant presence at Court was expected, he must have been familiar with life, gossip and intrigues of the Court. Furthermore, he had knowledge about the Danish court and Elsinore, probably imparted to him by envoys who had visited Elsinore. The scene of the play is Elsinore, but it mirrors the English court. In Elsinore is revisited we walk in the footsteps of the Queens envoys to see if we can discover how and why the site of Elsinore entered into the play and we meet men like Ramelius alias Polonius, but also Rosencrantz and Guildenstern who all entered the portrait gallery of famous characters in world literature. The purpose of Revisiting Elsinore has been to find a key to unveil the secret co-author of Hamlet. This has been done partly by a renewed reading of some primary and secondary sources, partly by discovery of an hitherto overlooked or neglected primary source.&lt;/p&gt;
