  <title>Across the Bloody Chasm: The Culture of Commemoration among Civil War Veterans - M. Keith Harris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Long after the Civil War ended, one conflict raged on: the battle to define and shape the war&#39;s legacy. Across the Bloody Chasm deftly examines Civil War veterans&#39; commemorative efforts and the concomitant -- and sometimes conflicting -- movement for reconciliation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though former soldiers from both sides of the war celebrated the history and values of the newly reunited America, a deep divide remained between people in the North and South as to how the country&#39;s past should be remembered and the nation&#39;s ideals honored. Union soldiers could not forget that their southern counterparts had taken up arms against them, while Confederates maintained that the principles of states&#39; rights and freedom from tyranny aligned with the beliefs and intentions of the founding fathers. Confederate soldiers also challenged northern claims of a moral victory, insisting that slavery had not been the cause of the war, and ferociously resisting the imposition of postwar racial policies. M. Keith Har-ris argues that although veterans remained committed to reconciliation, the sectional sensibilities that influenced the memory of the war left the North and South far from a meaningful accord.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harris&#39;s masterful analysis of veteran memory assesses the ideological commitments of a generation of former soldiers, weaving their stories into the larger narrative of the process of national reunification. Through regimental histories, speeches at veterans&#39; gatherings, monument dedications, and war narratives, Harris uncovers how veterans from both sides kept the deadliest war in American history alive in memory at a time when the nation seemed determined to move beyond conflict.&lt;/p&gt;" />
