  <title>Road to War: the Quest for a New World Order - Dr. Clifton Wilcox</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Every event has a beginning, middle, and end. The Road to War begins with the Treaty of Versailles. It is here where the seeds of instability in Europe are sown. While the 1930s bore witness to the rise of Adolf Hitler and the beginning of World War II, the 1920s were a unique and influential decade during which peace; order and stability were contested and constructed. World War I irrevocably altered the map of Europe and adversely affected each nation involved. The defeat of Germany left Europe in a state of chaos and the Allies, Britain and France, in the position of designing a lasting peace settlement. While the peacemakers were united in their desire to create a lasting peace, distrust and mutual suspicion began to take shape as they gathered in Versailles to decide the fate of Europe." />
