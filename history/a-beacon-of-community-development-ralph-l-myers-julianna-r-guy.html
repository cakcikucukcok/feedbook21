  <title>A Beacon of Community Development - Ralph L Myers, Julianna R Guy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;By the time you finish reading this book you will understand and appreciate how one neighborhood became a &lt;em&gt;Beacon of Community Development. &lt;/em&gt;The book will allow the reader&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;to witness and experience the steps and formation of the Cordata Neighborhood Association, and how&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;a small group of concerned and dedicated men and women over-came many obstacles, organized and developed it into one of the most influential and active neighborhood associations in Bellingham.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What started, in 2005 was a simple question and observation, &amp;ldquo;Where are the parks and trails? The lack of these amenities became painfully clear as hundreds of condos, apartments and single family homes sprang up in the north end of Bellingham in what was to become the Cordata neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the area grew, Whatcom Community College was built adding value and esthetic beauty.Still no plans for parks and trails for the growing populous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book narrates the change brought to the Cordata neighborhood, and author Ralph Myers with the invaluable help of Co-Founder Julianna Royal Guy memorializes the efforts of these dedicated and visionary founders of the CNA. So, sit back and prepare to go on this journey with those early visionaries.&lt;/p&gt;" />
