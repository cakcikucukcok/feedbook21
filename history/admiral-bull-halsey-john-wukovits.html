  <title>Admiral &quot;Bull&quot; Halsey - John Wukovits</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The definitive biography of America&#39;s best-known naval officer, who commanded the legendary fast carrier force during WWII.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the tragic aftermath of Pearl Harbor, when he fashioned America&#39;s first response to the attack, to the war&#39;s final day in Tokyo Bay when he witnessed Japan&#39;s surrender, Admiral William F. Halsey stamped a mighty imprint on the Pacific during World War II. He led or participated significantly in the Navy&#39;s first offensive strikes against the Marshall Islands and Wake Island, the Guadalcanal campaign, and the offensive toward Japan. As a commander, he never shied from engaging the enemy, but boldly entered into battle, ready for a fight. As a consequence, Halsey became the face of the Navy and its most attractive public relations phenomenon. Due to his bold tactics and quotable wit, Halsey continues to be a beloved and debated figure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this balanced biography, historian John Wukovits illuminates the life of a man who ultimately deserves recognition as one the great naval commanders in U.S. history. Europe had Patton; the Pacific had Admiral William &quot;the Bull&quot; Halsey.&lt;/p&gt;" />
