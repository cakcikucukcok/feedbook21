  <title>War Brides and Rosies - Barbara Ann Lambert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Nestled on the British Columbia coast, the community of Powell River sent several Canadian men and women overseas to fight in the World War II. When all was said and done, more than forty war bride families made their home in Powell River and the nearby town of Stillwater.
War Brides and Rosies compiles these families amazing stories and artfully captures the history of Powell River and Stillwater, British Columbia, during World War II. Barbara Ann Lambert recounts how the Powell River Company became a major player in war production as local girls became Rosies of the north, assembling planes for Boeing of Canada as well as running the largest pulp and paper mill in western Canada. 
Through their monthly newsletter, the company also became a social network. It included correspondence from Powell Rivers service men and women stationed around the world and news on overseas marriages. Using this resource, as well as accounts from war brides and their families, Lambert shows how these women influenced the communities and helped change the perspective of womens roles in Canadian society. 
Full of vivid detail, War Brides and Rosies is an important contribution to the local history of these Canadian communities." />
