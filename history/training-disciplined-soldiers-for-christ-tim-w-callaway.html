  <title>Training Disciplined Soldiers for Christ - Tim W. Callaway</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The comparative scarcity of academic attention given Prairie Bible Institute located at Three Hills, Alberta, Canada, serves as the primary motivation behind this book. This work should therefore be regarded as an attempt to contribute to and refine the very small amount of research available regarding how Prairie Bible Institutes first half-century should be understood and interpreted by students of North American church history.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Drawing on an insiders perspective of PBI, former PBI staff kid Tim W. Callaway challenges the adequacy and accuracy of Canadian scholar Dr. John G. Stackhouse, Jr.s inference that the kind of sectish evangelicalism that typified PBI in the twentieth century was substantially different from the characteristics that define the traditional understanding of American fundamentalism.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The undertaking contained in these pages advances the perspective that Prairie Bible Institute during the L.E. Maxwell era did in fact reflect the influence and attributes of American fundamentalism to a far greater extent than what Stackhouse allowed for in his research.&lt;/p&gt;" />
