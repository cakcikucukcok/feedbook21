  <title>Kansas&#39;s War: The Civil War in Documents - Pearl T. Ponce</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When the Civil War broke out in April 1861, Kansas was in a unique position. Although it had been a state for mere weeks, its residents were already intimately acquainted with civil strife. Since its organization as a territory in 1854, Kansas had been the focus of a national debate over the place of slavery in the Republic. By 1856, the ideological conflict developed into actual violence, earning the territory the sobriquet &quot;Bleeding Kansas.&quot; Because of this recent territorial strife, the state&#39;s transition from peace to war was not as abrupt as that of other states.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kansas&#39;s War&lt;/em&gt; illuminates the new state&#39;s main preoccupations: the internal struggle for control of policy and patronage; border security; and issues of race-especially efforts to come to terms with the burgeoning African American population and American Indians&#39; continuing claims to nearly one-fifth of the state&#39;s land. These documents demonstrate how politicians, soldiers, and ordinary Kansans understood the conflict and were transformed by the war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
