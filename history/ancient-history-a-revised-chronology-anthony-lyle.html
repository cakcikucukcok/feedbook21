  <title>Ancient History:  a Revised Chronology - Anthony Lyle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is a culmination of that research. After trashing his work 10 times and starting over, he managed to get a
revised chronology that seemed to be more accurate than that being put out by the status quo universities. It combines
secular / world history with Biblical history in a far more even and smoother match than that proposed by former
historians who have attempted the same. This is his version 12, which doesnt try to match different histories based on
dates, but rather by matching people and events and then applying revised dates to those events and people.
This work will call into question the conclusions of historians of the last 200 years, about the ancient periods of
time, and provide an alternative dating for those times. It is a World History in that it incorporates the ancient history of
India, China, Japan, as well as the traditional Middle Eastern and European societies of ancient times. It re-evaluates the
beginnings of civilization and the solar system, refuting common historical and scienti?? c beliefs of the modern world.
Documents that have previously been written off as Mythology have been re-evaluated as well, as they give a different
perspective of ancient times and what happened back then. The use and creation of calendars is an important feature
added to this work which is seldom taken into account by modern histories. Incorporated in this work are many of the
more recent archaeological ?? nds that have yet to be incorporated in status quo works and institutions. He makes no
apology for the fact that this is Biblically based, and the conclusions that have been reached by this work ?? t very well in
Biblical contexts and adds some understanding to the events that took place in the Biblical narratives." />
