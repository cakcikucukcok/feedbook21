  <title>The History of the Royal Warwickshire Regiment - Mark Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book covers the complete history of the Royal Warwickshire Regiment, formerly the 6th Regiment of Foot. The book follows the adventures of this regiment from its inception in Holland in the 1670&#39;s up until its dissolution in 1968. Covering 283 years of history the book charts the involvement of the regiment in well known conflicts like the First and Second World Wars as well as the more obscure ones scattered right across the globe. Special attention in this book is given to the context in which battles were fought and where possible the individuals that did that fighting. This is an e-book and so lacks the maps and images of the paperback version." />
