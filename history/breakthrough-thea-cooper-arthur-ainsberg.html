  <title>Breakthrough - Thea Cooper, Arthur Ainsberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It is 1919 and Elizabeth Hughes, the eleven-year-old daughter of America&#39;s most-distinguished jurist and politician, Charles Evans Hughes, has been diagnosed with juvenile diabetes. It is essentially a death sentence. The only accepted form of treatment - starvation - whittles her down to forty-five pounds skin and bones. Miles away, Canadian researchers Frederick Banting and Charles Best manage to identify and purify insulin from animal pancreases - a miracle soon marred by scientific jealousy, intense business competition and fistfights. In a race against time and a ravaging disease, Elizabeth becomes one of the first diabetics to receive insulin injections - all while its discoverers and a little known pharmaceutical company struggle to make it available to the rest of the world. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Relive the heartwarming true story of the discovery of insulin as it&#39;s never been told before. Written with authentic detail and suspense, and featuring walk-ons by William Howard Taft, Woodrow Wilson, and Eli Lilly himself, among many others.&lt;/p&gt;" />
