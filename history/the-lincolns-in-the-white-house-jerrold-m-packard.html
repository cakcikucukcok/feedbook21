  <title>The Lincolns in the White House - Jerrold M. Packard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From the day of Abraham Lincoln&#39;s inauguration, a nation divided by savage conflict confronted the new president. But what many don&#39;t know was that within the White House&#39;s walls, the Lincoln&#39;s family would soon find itself suffering turmoil mirroring that of the nation he led.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Savagely criticized for her extravagance by the American public and widely distrusted because of her southern roots, first lady Mary Lincoln&#39;s increasing instability would deeply strain her marriage and eventually end in her mental collapse. The couple was devastated when eleven-year-old Willie died in the White House of typhoid fever. Tad, the youngest son, remained the family joy despite his physical impairments. Though their son Robert&#39;s success at Harvard made his parents proud, his relationship with them was troubled and would result in a painful estrangement, one which would eventually permanently separate him from his mother. The president&#39;s assassination brutally crushed Mary&#39;s always-fragile spirits. After leaving the White House and following Tad&#39;s early death, the former first lady retreated into increasing eccentricity and seclusion until her death in 1882. A moving and poignant portrait of the family life of America&#39;s greatest president.&lt;/p&gt;" />
