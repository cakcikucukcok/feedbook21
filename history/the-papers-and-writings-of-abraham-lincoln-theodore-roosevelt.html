  <title>The Papers And Writings Of Abraham Lincoln - Theodore Roosevelt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Abraham Lincoln served as the 16th President of the United States from March 1861 until his assassination in April 1865. He successfully led the country through its greatest internal crisis, the American Civil War, preserved the Union, and ended slavery. He issued his Emancipation Proclamation in 1863, and promoted the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, abolishing slavery. This edition contains Volume One of the Selected Papers and Writings of Mr. Lincoln, carefully selected from the Lincoln Archives. It includes The Gettysburg Address and the Emancipation Proclamation, two of the most significant historical documents by Lincoln, and a cornerstone of our nation&amp;#39;s independence. It also contains an Introduction by Theodore Roosevelt. This book provides the reader with a rare glimpse into the intellect, humor and wit that made Abraham Lincoln one of the most important political figures not only in American History, but a man for and of the world at large and an icon for the ages.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;This book is quintessential Lincoln, capturing the essence of one of our greatest historical leaders&amp;quot; - The Congressional Record &amp;quot;This is the definitive collection of Lincoln&amp;#39;s writings.&amp;quot; - Washington Post&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Easy to read and highly thought provoking.&amp;quot; - U.S. News and World Report&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Theodore Roosevelt, Jr., also known as T.R., and to the public (but never to friends and intimates) as Teddy, was the twenty-sixth President of the United States, and a leader of the Republican Party and of the Progressive Movement. He became the youngest President in United States history at the age of 42. He served in many roles including Governor of New York, historian, naturalist, explorer, author, and soldier. Roosevelt is most famous for his personality: his energy, his vast range of interests and achievements, his model of masculinity, and his &amp;quot;cowboy&amp;quot; persona.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Roosevelt was mostly home schooled by tutors and his parents. Biographer H. W. Brands argues that &amp;quot;The most obvious drawback to the home schooling Roosevelt received was uneven coverage of the various areas of human knowledge.&amp;quot; He was solid in geography (as a result of self study during travels), and bright in history, biology, French, and German; however, he struggled in mathematics and the classical languages. He entered Harvard College on September 27, 1876; his father told him &amp;quot;Take care of your morals first, your health next, and finally your studies&amp;quot;." />
