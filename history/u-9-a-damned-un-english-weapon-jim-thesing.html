  <title>U-9: A Damned Un - English Weapon - Jim Thesing</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Merriam Press Historical Fiction Series. One morning in September 1914, a new and terrible weapon changed naval warfare forever. A single German submarine sank 3 British armored cruisers, killing nearly 1500 men. Up to that moment, few people knew submarines even existed. Overnight, terror swept England. At the beginning of the First World War, England&#39;s Royal Navy had the greatest fleet of warships the world had ever seen. Suddenly, because of one submarine&#39;s successful attack, the Royal Navy&#39;s supremacy was in question. Savage criticism rained down on the First Lord of the Admiralty, a young Winston Churchill. People are interested in events that changed the world, but few people know of this incident. It is a story that deserves to be told. With the centennial of World War I, now is the time to tell this story. Although this book is a work of fiction, it hews closely to historical events. Many of the people and most of the action described are based on memoirs written by participants in the 1920s. Map." />
