  <title>Pulpit and Nation: Clergymen and the Politics of Revolutionary America - Spencer W. McBride</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Pulpit and Nation,&lt;/i&gt; Spencer McBride highlights the importance     of Protestant clergymen in early American political culture, elucidating the actual role of     religion in the founding era. Beginning with colonial precedents for clerical involvement in     politics and concluding with false rumors of Thomas Jefferson&#39;s conversion to Christianity     in 1817, this book reveals the ways in which the clergy&#39;s political activism-and early     Americans&#39; general use of religious language and symbols in their political     discourse-expanded and evolved to become an integral piece in the invention of an American     national identity. Offering a fresh examination of some of the key junctures in the development     of the American political system-the Revolution, the ratification debates of 1787-88, and the     formation of political parties in the 1790s-McBride shows how religious arguments, sentiments,     and motivations were subtly interwoven with political ones in the creation of the early American     republic. Ultimately, &lt;i&gt;Pulpit and Nation&lt;/i&gt; reveals that while religious     expression was common in the political culture of the Revolutionary era, it was as much the     calculated design of ambitious men seeking power as it was the natural outgrowth of a devoutly     religious people.&lt;/p&gt;" />
