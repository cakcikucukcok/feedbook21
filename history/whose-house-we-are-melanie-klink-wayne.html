  <title>Whose House We Are - Melanie Klink Wayne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The history of St. Clements Church in El Paso, Texas, chronicles the sacred movement of God through generations of people who have powerfully experienced His presence. Follow this churchs story from humble beginnings in a dusty western outpost over a century ago, through decades of extraordinary growth and great social upheaval, to the renewal of the 1970s and the groundbreaking separation of the Episcopal and Anglican churches in North America. The Lord faithfully led this once small, insignificant group of believers to become one of the most dynamic Anglican churches in the country today, with broad missionary outreach and inner-city neighborhood ministries. The story of St. Clements is told through historical records and the testimonies of men and women, ministers and lay people, civic leaders and humble workers, and writers and musicians who served through many decades, all empowered by Gods Holy Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;" />
