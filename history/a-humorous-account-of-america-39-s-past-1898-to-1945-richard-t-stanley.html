  <title>A Humorous Account of America&#39;s Past:  1898 to 1945 - Richard T. Stanley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In 1898, the United States became an empire by accident due to our splendid little war against Spain. At the beginning of the 20th Century, the most famous men in America were not athletes or politicians; they were inventors and businessmen like Bell, Edison, Morgan, and Rockefeller. Teddy Roosevelt built the Panama Canal, launched the Great White Fleet, and became a Bull Moose. Woodrow Wilson was reelected in 1916 because He Kept Us Out of War! World War I began as a family feud between three European cousins named Georgie, Willie, and Nicky. The War to end all wars set the stage for World War II.
