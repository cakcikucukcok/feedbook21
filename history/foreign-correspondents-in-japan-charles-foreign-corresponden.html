  <title>Foreign Correspondents in Japan - Charles Foreign Corresponden</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Since its founding in 1945, the Foreign Correspondents Club of Japan (FCCJ) has been a haven for working journalists. From its origins at &quot;No. 1 Shimbun Alley&quot; in the ruins of Tokyo immediately after World War II, the club quickly took on a life of its own. At times it became like a miniature United Nations, meeting the needs of hundreds of foreign journalists from around the world, who used it as a working press center as well as a social oasis.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Club members, who include several Pulitzer Prize winners, have personally witnessed and reported on some of the most momentous events of the last half century-the end of World War II and the occupation of Japan; the revolution in China; the Korean War; Vietnam and the student riots of the 1960s; the height of the Cold War; Japan&#39;s economic miracle and the subsequent collapse of the &quot;bubble&quot; economy; the death of Emperor Hirohito; and much more.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;Foreign Correspondents in Japan&lt;/I&gt; gives an intimate and colorful look at these journalists who covered Asia for the rest of the world during five decades of sweeping change, and provides first-person accounts of history as it was being written.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
