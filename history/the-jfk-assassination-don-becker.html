  <title>The Jfk Assassination - Don Becker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;B&gt;Revised February, 2011&lt;/B&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I called the book a researchers guide for a reason. This book is a compilation of the material I read about the assassination, but in a totally different format. Easy to read; direct and to the point. I tried to give as much information as possible. Obviously I could not possibly put all the information in one book, so I was a bit selective in the data I recorded.  It contains numerous aspects of the case and nearly every line will lead the researcher to the source of the information so they can continue to look into that particular topic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started my research, my goal was to prove Lee Harvey Oswald did not murder John Kennedy. By the time I proved Oswald did not shoot Kennedy, I noticed Oswald did not shoot Tippet either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noting where he was seen before the shooting and where he was after the shooting will prove he was not at the window at 12:30pm; I will prove my point. I determined Oswald did not have time to get into position to do the shooting. The motorcade was scheduled to pass the Book Depository at 12:25 pm. Oswald was in the lunch room at 12:15 and Bonnie Ray Williams was on the 6th floor, alone, until 12:20. A good sniper would have been in position well in advance of his preys expected arrival, which Oswald was not. But wait theres more. . . &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at some of the evidence from a totally different perspective, I was able to prove, a conspiracy. I compared the wounds, with the Bullet count, and the time statistics of the rifle. I assure you no one has looked at it from this viewpoint. The closest any author came to mentioning this concept was Harrison Livingstones book, High Treason. &lt;/p&gt;" />
