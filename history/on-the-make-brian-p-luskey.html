  <title>On the Make - Brian P. Luskey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the bustling cities of the mid-nineteenth-century Northeast, young male clerks working in commercial offices and stores were on the make, persistently seeking wealth, respect, and self-gratification. Yet these strivers and &amp;quot;counter jumpers&amp;quot; discovered that claiming the identities of independent men&amp;#8212;while making sense of a volatile capitalist economy and fluid urban society&amp;#8212;was fraught with uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In &lt;b&gt;On the Make&lt;/b&gt;, Brian P. Luskey illuminates at once the power of the ideology of self-making and the important contests over the meanings of respectability, manhood, and citizenship that helped to determine who clerks were and who they would become. Drawing from a rich array of archival materials, including clerks&amp;#8217; diaries, newspapers, credit reports, census data, advice literature, and fiction, Luskey argues that a better understanding of clerks and clerking helps make sense of the culture of capitalism and the society it shaped in this pivotal era.&lt;/p&gt;" />
