  <title>Work: A Very Short Introduction - Stephen Fineman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The image of a job captures our imagination from an early age, usually prompted by the question &#39;What do you want to be when you grow up?&#39;. Work — paid, unpaid, voluntary, or obligatory — is woven into the fabric of all human societies. For many of us, it becomes part of our identity. For others it is a tedious necessity. Living is problematic without paid work, and for many it is catastrophic.
Steve Fineman tells the fascinating story of work - how we strive for security, reward, and often, meaning. Looking at how we classify &#39;work&#39;; the cultural and social factors that influence the way we work; the ethics of certain types of work; and the factors that will affect the future of work, from globalization to technology, this Very Short Introduction considers work as a concept and as a practical experience, drawing upon ideas from psychology, sociology, management, and social
history.
ABOUT THE SERIES: The Very Short Introductions series from Oxford University Press contains hundreds of titles in almost every subject area. These pocket-sized books are the perfect way to get ahead in a new subject quickly. Our expert authors combine facts, analysis, perspective, new ideas, and enthusiasm to make interesting and challenging topics highly readable." />
