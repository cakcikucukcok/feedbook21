  <title>Real Estate Recession Riches - Top 10 Real Estate Investing Tips That Don&#39;t Suck! - Cory Mdiv Boatright, Rodney Miller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Allow me to share my story with you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My name is Cory Boatright. I am 35 years old and since my early twenties I have started, run, or been directly involved with almost 40 different companies. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have sold everything from Ginsu knives on eBay, Kirby vacuum cleaners door-to-door, all the way to $50,000 high-end electronics Online. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Out of the forty-something companies only TWO of them ever proved to be worthwhile endeavors. The other thirty-eight I decided to call &amp;quot;business therapy&amp;quot;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Interestingly enough, both of the successful companies harnessed the power of the Internet to make their profits. After bringing in almost 4 million dollars in sales from my first start-up. I sold it and directed my passion to the world of real estate investing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why real estate?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Well, most of my affluent customers in my first business owned real estate so I knew there was something to be learned in that industry. I was a complete novice to it And...oh...by the way before I forget...did I mention that I didn&amp;#39;t even graduate from high school? Apparently my drive to succeed coupled with my persistence to not fail clouded my judgment of the value of a formal education. So instead, I settled for a G.E.D. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#39;m not looking for any pity-party. I just mentioned this to demonstrate that if a highschool dropout can make it, the doors are open for just about anyone else to do it too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now fast forward a bit into my real estate experiences. I started out being a &amp;quot;bird dog&amp;quot; which means I was out finding good deals on properties and getting paid a finders fee for it. That fee was usually $500 &amp;ndash; $1,500. After I learned how much money the investor was making selling the houses I was bringing him, I quickly learned how to assign, wholesale and flip distressed properties. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That brought in checks anywhere from $3,000 &amp;ndash; $10,000. Not bad, but I had a hunch those properties were worth a lot more after they were fixed up. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So I decided to put together a &amp;quot;skeleton&amp;quot; rehab crew and thought I would make $15,000 &amp;ndash; $30,000 per deal, but I was sadly mistaken. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My rehab attempts ended up being more of a mirage instead of a real profit center. My $30,000 paydays actually came out to be more around $17,500 after considering all the contractor frustrations, material costs, labor, marketing, selling and other holding costs. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Needless to say I had more fun assigning contracts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It wasn&amp;#39;t until around 2004 that I stumbled my way through a short sale and I made over $30,000 on that deal! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That was the most money that I had ever made on one single real estate transaction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I couldn&amp;#39;t believe the lender would accept less than what was owed for a payoff. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was immediately hooked and quickly learned everything possible about the short sale process. The more I learned about Short Sales, the more I was asked by other investors to partner on deals. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I quickly became known as the local &amp;quot;go-to&amp;quot; guy for doing short sales. Other investors continually asked me how they too could learn to do what I was doing. So after being asked by numerous fellow investors to teach and coach them on the subject, I decided to &amp;quot;dive in head first&amp;quot; and write my first information product/home study course.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What I discovered in real estate investing was something I never expected. Not only was the short sale niche secretive, but the entire industry. And the &amp;quot;real truth&amp;quot; was shared only amongst a small, tight knit group of investors, but not anymore.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#39;ve cornered the &amp;quot;top dogs&amp;quot; in their niche of real estate investing and forced them to talk.
