&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Fields of Green&lt;/i&gt;, author and CPA Terry Brown shares some commonsense strategies for intelligently navigating todays complex financial opportunities. From his days growing up on a farm, Brown learned a strong work ethic and a clear vision of financial realities from a young age. Years later, lessons gleaned from working in corporate finance rounded out his approach to financial management and stewardship. Regardless of background, education, or vocation, everyone faces similar challengesneeds and wants, credit card debt, college funding, and retirement planning. Today, retirement and medical plans are much less attractive than they were even a generation ago. The keys to financial security are within your reach, but you need to understand the basic truths firstand those are what Brown offers here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By breaking down what most consider to be impossibly complicated financial theories, Brown shares these truths with the layperson.
