  <title>Creating a Green and Cultural Economy - Ram Ramprasad</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A unique book that takes the reader into the depths and mysteries of creating a wondrous people-initiated economic plan grounded in centuries of cultural and ecological wisdom. In a tapestry of factual and everyday events, the author makes a well-reasoned argument that we first need to address culture, then a sustainable lifestyle, then ecology, and finally economics. The author strongly reasons that this paradigm in the current century has been reversed by all the countries of the world. The authors compelling argument makes the reader ask some thought-provoking questions: Is our present state of affairs increasing costs in all areas of the economy? Is our system of education placing a distorted emphasis in creating an army of misplaced problem solvers? Is this the right approach? What is cultural economy? Is a culture-based economy better than a consumer economy?&lt;p&gt;
The adventure-filled story telling in this book is a blend of the ancient wisdom of the East with
suggestions to using the right sources of practical technological wisdom from the East and the West. It takes the current state of our affairs and economic planning and simply turns the current logic on its head. The reader finds several clues on how to implement and create a people-initiated economic plan without necessarily changing his or her current station in life. The beauty of the book is that any person can help create a technological culture that is aligned with nature and ecology. A scholarly book that offers a fascinating reading, as pleasant as reading a novel." />
