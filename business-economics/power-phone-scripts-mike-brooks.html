  <title>Power Phone Scripts - Mike Brooks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Start closing sales like top producers!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Have you ever found yourself at a loss for what to say when the gatekeeper asks you what your call is about? Have your palms ever sweated when the decision maker shuts you down with: “I wouldn’t be interested”? Has your heart taken a fast dive into your stomach when, at the start of your presentation, your prospect tells you that they’ve thought about it and are just going to pass?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you’re in sales, then the question isn’t “Have you ever felt this way?”, but rather, “How often do you feel this way? Are you finally ready to learn how to confidently and effectively overcome these objections, stalls, and blow-offs? If so, &lt;i&gt;Power Phone Scripts&lt;/i&gt; was written for you! Unlike other books on sales that tell you what you should do (like build value – hard to do when the prospect is hanging up on you!), &lt;i&gt;Power Phone Scripts&lt;/i&gt; provides word-for-word scripts, phrases, questions, and comebacks that you can use on your very next call. Learn to overcome resistance, get through to the decision maker, and then, once you have him or her on the phone, make an instant connection and earn the right to have a meaningful conversation. You’ll be equipped with proven questions, conversation starters, and techniques to learn whether or not they are even right for your product or service, and, if they aren’t, who else in their company or another department might be.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Power Phone Scripts&lt;/i&gt; is the sales manual you’ve been looking for: over 500 proven, current, and non-salesy phrases, rebuttals, questions, and conversation openers that will instantly make you sound more confident – just like the top producing sales pros do right now. Gone will be your call reluctance; gone will be your fear of calling prospects back for presentations and demos; gone will be the fear of asking for the sale at the end of your pitch! This practical guide is filled with effective scripts for prospecting, emailing, voice mails, closes, and tons of rebuttals to recurring objections you get like:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;“It costs too much”&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;“We already have a vendor for that”&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;“I’m going to need to think about it”&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;“I need to talk to the boss or committee” and so many others…&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;More than just phone scripts, this book provides practical, comprehensive guidance that every inside sales rep needs. Conquer concerns, provide answers, motivate action, and be the conduit between your prospect’s problems and your solution. Actionable, fun, and designed to work within the current sales environment, this invaluable guide is your ticket to the top of the leader board. With &lt;i&gt;Power Phone Scripts&lt;/i&gt;, you will never be at a loss of what to say to a prospect or client.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Communication is everything in sales, and being on top of your game is no longer enough when top producers are playing a different game altogether. You cannot achieve winning stats if you&#39;re not even on the field. If you&#39;re ready to join the big league, &lt;i&gt;Power Phone Scripts&lt;/i&gt; is the playbook you need to win at inside sales.&lt;/p&gt;" />
