  <title>Egoless - Dr. Sarah A. Morris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The case for a new way of leadership is compelling.  Traditional models are struggling to deliver the right results for organisations or individuals, and the relationship between organisation and employees is more fragile than ever.  Too few employees are fully engaged, empowered or committed to the organisation of which they are part.  It is simply not sustainable.
Drawing on her exploration the influence of consciousness on leadership and her observations and insights as a coach, Dr. Sarah Morris makes a powerful case for taking ego out of the office.  Ego-less leadership, she argues, is truly transformational and creates balanced, sustainable and high performing teams and environments and delivers exceptional results. 
Drawing upon an original and simple four step model called the Conscious Leadership Model, Egoless: The Final Frontier in Leadership sets out a practical route towards a more fulfilling way of leading, and one which benefits not only leaders themselves but also those they lead.  Powerful argument, case histories and practical exercises open up a whole new approach to leadership and to life." />
