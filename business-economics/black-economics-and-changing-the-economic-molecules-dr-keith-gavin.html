  <title>Black Economics  and Changing the Economic Molecules - Dr. Keith Gavin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="We must meet God on the road, for he is waiting for us to come up with new and fresh ideas and strategies. God wants you to know that he is still in control or he has theocracy. God wants to remind us that we must mark our goals, plan our direction, and set out to meet him on the road of struggle. Who is on the Lords side? Do we trust God at his Word that he will never leave us or forsake us? And what role do we play in the ecumenical arena, meaning the economy of God? We cannot build safely on false foundations, for truth makes a new creature in whom old things pass away and all things will become new.
It has been recorded that not one word that God has written in the Bible has failed nor has nothing been added that cannot be explained. So what is the condition that requires God to meet you at your level? How can God help you out of the condition if you will not help yourself? You must be available to God, and then he will be available to you, for he will meet you where you need him. God will come to your level. If everyone around you is being blessed and you find yourself wanting and waiting for a blessing, did you ask God to come and meet you at your condition? Then how can God come down to your level if you will not meet him there?" />
