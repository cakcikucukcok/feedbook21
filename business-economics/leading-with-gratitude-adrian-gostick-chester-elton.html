  <title>Leading with Gratitude - Adrian Gostick, Chester Elton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The influential &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling authors&amp;#8212;the &amp;#8220;apostles of appreciation&amp;#8221; Chester Elton and Adrian Gostick&amp;#8212;provide managers and executives with easy ways to add more gratitude to the everyday work environment to help bolster moral, efficiency, and profitability.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Workers want and need to know their work is appreciated. Showing gratitude to employees is the easiest, fastest, most inexpensive way to boost performance.
