  <title>Disrupting Digital Business - R &quot;Ray&quot; Wang</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;We are no longer an economy of products and services. The digital transformation demands that we focus our attention on experiences and outcomes. Business leaders and their organizations must shift to keeping promises&amp;#151;no matter how their customers interact with them.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;But organizations no longer control the conversation. In this era of social and mobile technology, customers, employees, suppliers, and partners are in direct communication with one another. Those personal networks and the brands they&amp;#8217;re passionate about influence their decision making and their spending.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The workforce has changed too. Employees expect to be able to determine when and how they will work, the technology they&amp;#8217;ll use, and the values their company will espouse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Organizations can take part in this conversation only if they recognize how and where it&amp;#8217;s happening. Resisting these changes will leave executives, managers, and their companies powerless. Organizations must pivot with and ahead of these social, organizational, and technological shifts or risk being left behind.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Technology guru Ray Wang shows how organizations can surf the waves of change&amp;#151;how they can keep their promises. Current trends, when taken seriously, require a new way of thinking about business that includes five key areas:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;1.  Consumerization of technology and the new C-suite&lt;BR&gt;2.  Data&amp;#8217;s influence in driving decisions&lt;BR&gt;3.  Digital marketing transformation&lt;BR&gt;4.  The future of work&lt;BR&gt;5.  Matrix commerce&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Digital disruption has changed how we do our work. But by mastering these trends you&amp;#8217;ll delight your customers with every interaction.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
