  <title>The CEO&#39;s Strategy Handbook: How to Create, sustain and Accelerate Profitable Growth - Stuart Cross</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There are many books on strategy, but very few focus on helping the CEO fulfil their role in leading strategy in their organisation. The CEO&#39;s Strategy Handbook will give CEOs and senior executives provocative insights and pragmatic advice to setting strategy, leading the strategy process, and turning winning strategies into great results. The term &#39;strategy&#39; has, with the help of consultants and academics, developed a mystique that makes it sound difficult, complicated and only for people with an IQ greater than 150. This book aims to smash through this misconception, and show CEOs that strategy is a critical element in improving the performance of their business and is a straightforward - and even enjoyable - process that they can feel confident in mastering. The fundamentals to great strategy and effective implementation remain the same. Setting a clear direction, rigorously identifying and pursuing opportunities where the organisation has competitive advantages, are the ways in which the CEO can make a strategy come to life and deliver dramatic and sustainable success. This book shows CEOs how they can make this happen in their organisation. It will include case studies, self-tests, interviews with leading CEOs, charts, frameworks and action plans to help bring the ideas alive for my readers. Stuart Cross is a consultant, coach and speaker who helps world class companies dramatically accelerate profit growth." />
