  <title>Smarter, Faster, Better - Karlin Sloan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From the Inside Flap&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I know you are already smart, fast, and good. Now it&amp;#39;s time to become smarter, faster, and better. It&amp;#39;s time to ask questions, slow down, and start focusing not on just your own self-development but on your contribution to your team, your organization, and the greater good.&amp;quot;&amp;mdash;From the Introduction&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this groundbreaking book, acclaimed executive coach Karlin Sloan&amp;nbsp;offers leaders a variety of self-assessments, habits, strategies, and sustainable practices&amp;nbsp;that they can use to become what today&amp;#39;s marketplace demands: smarter, faster, and better.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sloan shows what it takes to make the move to the next level to become a leader who both grows the bottom line and contributes to stakeholders and the world in a positive way. Based on research, study, and the author&amp;#39;s extensive experience as a coach to leaders of top organizations, this book shows how to become smarter, faster, and better by examining these questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;What are your key strengths and what do you need to develop or leverage?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;What are you focused on now and what do you need to accomplish to really get ahead?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Are your values in line with your work? What is the end you are trying to achieve?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smarter, Faster, Better is solution-focused. It helps leaders gain perspective and self-knowledge, seize opportunities they may not have seen before, achieve their highest potential, and resolve the issues that threaten to hold them back from the success they desire for themselves and their organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reviews&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;For those of us constantly striving to operate smarter, faster, and better, Karlin Sloan reminds us sagely, through wonderful stories, that we may well achieve our highest levels of performance, potential, and fulfillment by asking questions, slowing down, and being of service. Great advice for a weary world and particularly for leaders seeking sustained peak performance for themselves and the organizations they lead.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;mdash;Timothy Dorman, chief operating officer, leadership coaching and development, Korn/Ferry International&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Karlin Sloan nails the essentials of leading and motivating a senior management team for measurable success by both understanding and tapping into the power of human interaction.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;mdash;Tom Bernardin, chairman and CEO, Leo Burnett Worldwide, Inc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;This book hits a home run when it comes to offering sound and practical ways to face the pace and pressures of increasing complexity and overload&amp;mdash;and to show up as an effective leader when results have to be innovative. Smarter, Faster, Better helped me see how slowing down to move forward faster can transform my experience of being a leader in a growth industry.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;mdash;Steve Kowalski, director, learning and development, Genentech, Inc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How often have you said to yourself, &amp;#39;I need help,&amp;#39; &amp;#39;I don&amp;#39;t have enough time,&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;I&amp;#39;m stressed&amp;#39;? Karlin Sloan offers us an opportunity to learn practical strategies for bringing out the best in ourselves as well as in others through examining the lives of many leaders she has coached. Prepare to reflect and learn where your strengths lie.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
