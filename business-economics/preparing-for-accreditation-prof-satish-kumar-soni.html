  <title>Preparing for Accreditation - Prof. Satish Kumar Soni</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Improving and assuring the quality of professional educational services is the only last option left for forward-looking educational service enterprises or colleges or universities for surviving with pride and creating delight in customer students. For relatively younger economies like India and other Asian African countries, quality assurance has become almost mandatory from both the point of views: business growth and complying with the requirements of regulatory agencies. 
Many Asian countries have become provisional signatory members of Washington Accord for facilitating global mobility of graduates from universities of one country to another country for further education and/or seeking employment opportunities. Recently, regulatory agencies of many developing countries have adopted outcome-based professional education model for formulating criteria and evaluation procedures for quality assurance and accreditation certification. 
The author, while doing consultancy work in India, has felt that faculty, in general, are not very much aware of the requirements of outcome-based education model and, therefore, face difficulties in preparing self-assessment reports and supporting evidence record files. It is hoped that this book shall be of adequate help to faculty and management of professional education institutions and universities in understanding the requirements of accreditation and in making necessary preparations of application and documentation." />
