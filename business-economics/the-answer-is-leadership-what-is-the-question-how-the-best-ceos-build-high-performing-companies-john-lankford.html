  <title>The Answer is Leadership What is the Question: How the best CEOs build high-performing companies - John Lankford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Just a small percentage of business leaders are exceptional and consistently outperform their competition. It comes down to one word: leadership. Leadership is the answer to every business problem you&amp;#39;re facing. The quality of your leadership will be directly reflected in your company&amp;#39;s culture, employees, customers, profitability, and ultimately, future. John Lankford wants to challenge the way business owners and executives think about running companies, getting them to understand what it&amp;#39;s costing them by not having a strategic plan to develop their current and future leaders. Having the right people in the right positions and making leadership development a priority, on all levels, will create the right kind of company culture that attracts top talent, brings in new business, and retains current customers. In his book The Answer Is Leadership . . . What Is the Question?, Lankford presents his blueprint you can follow. He&amp;#39;ll show you what the best of the best are doing, and tell you how you can apply those same principles, processes, and systems to your own company, strategies that work regardless of company size. Results based, tested, and proven, this is a collection of best business practices that Lankford has learned through his 30-plus years of working with executives from Fortune 100 companies to small entrepreneurs.&lt;/p&gt;" />
