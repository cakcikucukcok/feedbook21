  <title>Social Entrepreneurship: The Secret to Starting a Business Worth Living For - Marcel N. Kwedi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Can hunger be a good business? Yes, and in fact, it is the only business that has ever been. Whatever the business you are in, you are in the hunger business: hunger for food, hunger for clothing, hunger for transportation, etc. This book extends the notion of Social Entrepreneurship and places it into a bigger picture: the entrepreneurship for the masses. The book revisits every aspect of business administration (microeconomics, marketing, operations and innovation) and turns them into powerful tools to help normal people make the World around them a better place.  The book brings with it three key innovations: - A presentation of Marketing in a way that can be understood even by children; - A step by step innovation process that can turn anyone into a new Steve Jobs; - A pure excel-based operation simulation model.  All the revenues generated from the book sale will be used exclusively in the financing of social enterprises around the World through the crowd funding portal WOHAOO dot com." />
