  <title>Shakespeare Monologues for Men - Luke Dixon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Full of fresh speeches from Shakespeare&amp;#8217;s plays, this is the ideal guide for actors of all ages and experience.&lt;/p&gt; As an actor at any level you are likely to be called upon to perform a speech from Shakespeare. A great deal will depend on your coming up with something fresh that is suited both to your particular performing skills and to the purposes of the audition. This is where this volume of &lt;I&gt;The Good Audition Guides&lt;/I&gt; comes in.&lt;p&gt;Drawing on his extensive experience as a theatre director and in drama training, Luke Dixon has chosen fifty monologues for male actors from across the whole of Shakespeare&#39;s canon. Featured here are some of the very best-loved works (such as &lt;I&gt;A Midsummer Night&amp;#8217;s Dream&lt;/I&gt;, &lt;I&gt;Henry V&lt;/I&gt; and &lt;I&gt;Hamlet&lt;/I&gt;) alongside many less well-known (and often more intriguing) speeches from plays like &lt;I&gt;Love&amp;#8217;s Labour&amp;#8217;s Lost&lt;/I&gt;, &lt;I&gt;King John&lt;/I&gt; and &lt;I&gt;Titus Andronicus&lt;/I&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; Each monologue is prefaced with a neat summary of the vital information you need to place the piece in context and to perform it to maximum effect and in your own unique way. The volume also features a user-friendly introduction on the whole process of selecting your speech, tackling Shakespeare&amp;#8217;s language and approaching the audition itself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;#145;&lt;B&gt;Sound practical advice for anyone attending an audition&lt;/B&gt;&amp;#8217; &lt;I&gt;Teaching Drama Magazine&lt;/I&gt; on &lt;I&gt;The Good Audition Guides&lt;/I&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
