  <title>The Demise of Labor - Ahakuelo Brian</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Unions are Dying a Slow Death&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organized labor, once a powerful force for social and economic justice in America, is rapidly fading into obscurity, with unions bleeding members from their rosters even in the most labor-friendly regions of the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nobody knows this better than Brian Ahakuelo, co-founder of the Global Institute for Interest-Based Solutions and former Business Manager of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 1260. A second-generation member of the IBEW, Brian grew up revering American workers and the unions that served them. But he also watched Big Labor devolve from a progressive movement to a bloated, self-serving bureaucracy more concerned with preserving their power base than the plight of workers. Determined to change all that, Brian created a business-based model that focused on creating strong, sustainable relationships between companies and workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the IBEW leadership viewed Local 1260&amp;rsquo;s success not as a victory for its members but a threat to its power. On May 6, 2016 three of Ahakuelo&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;brothers&amp;rdquo; showed up at the office and without preamble placed Local 1260 under trusteeship. Ahakuelo was given three minutes to collect his things and get out. This was followed by a vicious media onslaught that maligned him and his family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many would have crumbled, Ahakuelo decided he would not only survive, but thrive. The Demise of Labor: The Brian Ahakuelo Story exposes the real reasons behind the decline of unions in this country and one man&amp;rsquo;s determination to inspire the American worker to live with faith, passion and purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This extraordinary book should be required reading for all students, teachers, employers and employees in all industries and institutions of learning. Changes in labor laws, job markets, and today&amp;rsquo;s workforce make this book a must read.&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash; Dr. Mathew Friedman PHD, Doctor of Economics.&lt;/p&gt;" />
