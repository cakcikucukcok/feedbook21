  <title>Understanding Relationship Selling - Catherine Mattiske</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In selling there is one simple truth - most of the business you do is based on the relationships that you have with your customers, and your best customers are the ones with whom you have the best relationships. When your customers like you, respect you and trust you, the relationship will continue to create value long after the first sale, boosting long term profitability and success.  This Learning Short-take combines self-study with workplace activities to develop skills in relationship selling. Participants will compare traditional selling techniques with more modern sales processes based on the development of trust, rapport and empathy. Participants will evaluate their own approach to selling, and develop new and innovative strategies to foster key relationships, understand customer needs, and provide appropriate sales solutions. This Learning Short-take is designed for completion in approximately 90 minutes.  Learning Objectives • Define relationship selling. • Explain the difference between traditional selling and relationship selling. • State key differences between product-based selling and needs-based selling. • Explain the importance of trust in relationship selling. • Explain the principles of relationship selling. • Describe how to maintain a relationship even when the answer is &#39;no&#39;. • Identify the steps in the relationship selling process. • Create a Skills Development Action." />
