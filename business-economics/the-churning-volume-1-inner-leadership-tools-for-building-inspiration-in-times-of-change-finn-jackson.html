  <title>The Churning Volume 1, Inner Leadership: Tools for Building Inspiration in Times of Change - Finn Jackson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The essence of great leadership, Finn Jackson reminds us, is the creation of two things: inspiration and results.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In this book he focuses on inspiration, and provides an integrated set of tools for inspiring ourselves and others during times of change.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The benefits come in three stages.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Used individually, these tools enable us to address the specific issues that arise in times of change. We learn to steady ourselves more quickly and make clearer sense of the situation. We learn to find new opportunities in even the most challenging circumstances and convert the best of them into an inspiring vision.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Used together, the tools in this book form a step by step process for transforming not only the situations we face but also ourselves. We become stronger leaders, expanding our leadership reach and becoming more able to inspire ourselves and others to make things happen.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ultimately we find that by applying these tools we and our organisations can become &amp;lsquo;antifragile&amp;rsquo;: able not only to survive change but to thrive because of it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In times of change we all need to focus on what matters most to us and inspire ourselves and other people to achieve that.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Leaders from all walks of life and at all levels who apply the tools in this book will flourish in this time of change, together with their organisations and the people around them.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The book comes with a free&amp;nbsp;electronic workbook containing fillable forms and instructions for all the tools and exercises.&lt;/p&gt;" />
