  <title>The Age of Abundance - Brink Lindsey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Until the 1950s, the struggle to feed, clothe, and employ the nation drove most of American political life.

But with the explosion of the nation&#39;s economy in the years after World War II, a new set of needs began to emerge&amp;#8212;a search for meaning and self-expression on one side, and a quest for stability and a return to traditional values on the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The Age of Abundance&lt;/em&gt;, Brink Lindsey offers a bold reinterpretation of the latter half of the twentieth century. In this sweeping history of postwar America, the tumult of racial and gender politics, the rise of the counterculture, and the conservative revolution of the 1980s and 1990s are portrayed in an entirely new light.

The book is a breathtaking reevaluation of our recent past&amp;#8212;and will change the way we think about the future.&lt;/p&gt;" />
