  <title>Train Your Brain - Dana Wilde</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Using Train Your Brain, in two years, Ive gone from zero to a&lt;br /&gt;
million dollars a year in my business and paid off $30,000 in debt!&lt;br /&gt;
~ Sarah Thomas, Basehor, KS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Dana Wilde began her direct-sales business, she realized that education for entrepreneurs typically consisted of endless how-to explanations: how to market, how to pick up the phone, how to manage your time, how to increase bookings or sales. There always seemed to be a new system to learn, a new surefire method or cutting-edge technique for entrepreneurs to master. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an effort to teach her team members a better and easier way, Dana Wilde created Train Your Brain, a tested and proven system combining elements of both mindset and action  or as Dana likes to call it, Intentional Action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Dana discovered by using Train Your Brain is that mindset can be taught and that learning simple mindset strategies not only allows you to understand how the brain works but also shows you how easy it is to change your thinking and, as a result, change your outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Train Your Brain, Dana breaks down the Cycle of Perpetual Samenessthe number one reason why most people only experience incremental change in their lives. More importantly, she also provides the much-needed blueprint to help you get off this counterproductive cycle quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Train Your Brain, with its twenty easy-to-implement Mindware Experiments, gives you all the necessary tools needed to get off  and stay off  the Cycle of Perpetual Sameness, so you can transform your life and grow your business in record time!&lt;/p&gt;" />
