  <title>Summary: Duty, Honor, Company - Gil Dorland and John Dorland - BusinessNews Publishing</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This work offers a summary of the book “DUTY, HONOR, COMPANY: West  Point Fundamentals For Business Success” by Gil Dorland and John Dorland.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most people agree that business is war -- except the primary goal in business is to win market share and make money rather than seize territory or kill the enemy. Therefore, if the military paradigm fits the business world, by studying what succeeds in military battles, you can gain insights into what is likely to succeed in the business arena.&lt;br&gt;The finest source of military brilliance in the modern world has consistently originated from the United States Military Academy at West Point, which was founded in 1802. Thus, the time-tested methodologies taught there should be rigorously examined for their transferability to business.&lt;br&gt;The three essential pillars of the West Point philosophy are summed up in its motto: Duty, Honor, Country. In a business context, this underlying philosophy can be translated as Duty, Honor, Company. A business leader with a sense of duty inspires and motivates his or her coworkers. Honor is the foundation of great character traits. And ultimately the company must flourish if it is to endure and succeed.&lt;br&gt;Accordingly, taking the lead from West Point, leadership, discipline, high ethical standards and investments in the future should become the paramount business priorities. At the same time, business managers should focus on providing leadership and ethics for every person in the company organization. Only when business managers actually get out front and lead will the enterprise flourish and become great.&lt;br&gt;Duty, honor, company serves exceptionally well both as a motto and a way of life." />
