  <title>2018 Healthcare Reform Facts - Michael D. Thomas, J.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="If there are continuing constants in healthcare reform, it is change and confusion. The last year has evidenced both of these. This fully updated 2018 Healthcare Reform Facts eliminates confusion and makes sense of ongoing changes by sorting through new events to identify and define vital developments, and most importantly, provide clear, concise guidance.
2018 Healthcare Reform Facts contains hundreds of the most frequently asked questions on the implementation, 
compliance, and tax implications of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). In these pages, you’ll find easy-access Q&amp;A guidance on: 
 » The components of healthcare reform
 » Implementation of healthcare reform provisions, as well as provisions which have been repealed, delayed or modified
 » Understanding of the marketplace exchanges- Reasons employers should or should not continue to offer health insurance
 » Legal challenges to the Affordable Care Act or components thereof
 » Coverage mandates and enforcement; disclosures and required reporting
 » And much more! 
And for 2018, this cutting-edge resource has been fully revised to cover:  
 » Employer Mandate implementation including compliance thresholds; eligibility penalties; affordability requirement penalties; 
    “safe harbor” rules
 » Problems with– and potential elimination of the SHOP Exchanges
 » Taxes including the future of the “Cadillac tax”, expanded coverage of the Health Insurance Providers tax, the Medical Device 
    Tax, the Tanning Bed Tax, Additional Medicare Tax, and the Medicare Tax on Investments
 » The Individual Mandate and the effect of President Trump’s Executive Order as well as changes to penalties and updated 
     coverage of hardship exemptions
 » Status of grandmothered and grandfathered plans- Changes to the Marketplace exchanges and 2018 Enrollment periods 
    as well as updates to tax credit eligibility for tax credits and cost-sharing reductions
 » Expanded coverage of Minimum Essential Coverage and Minimum Value as well as discussion of the future of the “economic 
    substance” doctrine
 » Expanded coverage of Professional Employer Organizations (PEOs) including expansion and certification of CPEOs and effect 
    on contingent workers
 » Updated discussion of popular benefits of the Affordable Care Act including Essential Health Benefits, coverage of dependents 
    until age 26, limitations on rescissions, pre-existing conditions and coverage of women’s health services
 » Small Employer Tax credits; Cafeteria plans, Catastrophic plan eligibility; HSAs, HRAs, FSAs, EAPs, and HDHPs limits; updated 
    Summary of Benefits and Coverage, Model Notices and FPLs as well as rules for HPIDs and OEIDs 
 » Comparison of the Affordable Care Act with “repeal and replace” proposals 
By bringing together the guidance, rules, and regulations from all the governing bodies into a single complete resource, and providing answers to the most pressing questions, 2018 Healthcare Reform Facts stands apart as the single source for authoritative, insightful, and up-to-date answers on healthcare reform—all in a convenient, time-saving Q&amp;A format." />
