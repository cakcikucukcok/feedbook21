  <title>The New Pioneers - J.P. Faber</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Imagine a world where there are no building codes, no licensing requirements, no permit fees, no inspectors&amp;#151;no rules or regulations, only common sense and the desire to build something better. This is the world that forged America, the land where the early pioneers and town developers thrived.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;But this type of open environment is long gone.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It&amp;#8217;s prohibitively expensive for young entrepreneurs to start a business today. In fact, it is almost impossible to build anything unless you are part of a larger organization that has the expertise and resources to navigate the system. Our municipal, state, and federal codes, from business permitting and OSHA compliance to occupational licenses and tax requirements, have blossomed out of control.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Today&amp;#8217;s innovators and builders must ignore the rules, go to places where the rules are not enforced, or figure out how to get around them. &lt;I&gt;The New Pioneers&lt;/I&gt; is the story of Americans&amp;#151;millennials, immigrants, artists, and entrepreneurs&amp;#151;who are doing just that in cities across the nation, including Detroit, San Diego, New Orleans, Phoenix, and many more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Written by journalist J.P. Faber, &lt;I&gt;The New Pioneers&lt;/I&gt; shows the entrepreneurs of today, especially those in urban areas, how they can work around obstacles to create wealth and revive our cities. Small business owners and individual builders have the power to fix what&amp;#8217;s broken in society&amp;#151;if only they are allowed to do so.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This book is an optimistic look at how we can rebuild our cities and jump-start more small businesses. It shows how we can make far better use of our resources, both human and physical. &lt;I&gt;The New Pioneers&lt;/I&gt; paves a road to success in a crumbling world. It&amp;#8217;s time for the little guy to have a fighting chance to get ahead once again.&lt;/div&gt;" />
