  <title>Mentoring Pocketbook - Geof Alred</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;The Mentoring Pocketbook &amp;#150; now in its third edition &amp;#150; shows how to design and manage a mentoring scheme, how to prepare to be a mentor, how to conduct mentoring sessions, how to maintain the relationship through the different stages and how to evaluate mentoring.&lt;br&gt; Before looking at the actual mentoring process, the authors deal with the uses of mentoring within organisations (particularly in the context of managing change and mission/value statements) and explain how mentoring differs from coaching, training and appraisals.&lt;br&gt; The process of mentoring is explained with the aid of a 3-stage model. This can be used to assess yourself as a mentor, as a map to guide you through the process, as a review tool and as a means to develop the mentee&#39;s ability to use the model independently.&lt;br&gt; Subsequent chapters explore the mentor-mentee relationship and address key issues and questions. Although primarily aimed at the mentor, The Mentoring Pocketbook is also helpful to mentees.&lt;br&gt; A consistently best-selling title within the Management Pocketbooks Series!&lt;br&gt; &amp;#147;Mentoring is probably the most powerful developmental process people can experience. And when it works, it develops two for the price of one. The Mentoring Pocketbook is a no-nonsense primer for the first-time mentor or mentee.&amp;#8221; Prof. David Clutterbuck, Co-founder, The European Mentoring and Coaching Council&lt;br&gt; &amp;#147;The Mentoring Pocketbook is the basis of the Mentoring Programme at M&amp;#246;venpick Hotels &amp; Resorts. Mentoring has been fundamental to supporting our approach to talent development throughout the company. Not only is it providing our top talent with the support they need to make the challenging transition to more senior leadership roles but it also supports our current generation of business leaders. Mentoring has greatly enhanced their unique contribution to the company and the company&#39;s learning and development culture.&amp;#8221; Bruce Harkness, VP Learning &amp; Development, M&amp;#246;venpick Hotels &amp; Resorts Management AG&lt;/div&gt;" />
