  <title>Leadership: It’S Not That Hard! - Lucas Chang</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;ITS AN AGE-OLD QUESTION:&lt;/b&gt;
how do you develop and hone the skills you need to lead a team ?
&lt;p&gt;You could enroll in a leadership course or buy technical books. Or, you could learn what you need to know from movies, television and comic books! Some of the best case studies and leadership qualities can be found in what we watch and read for fun. Join Lucas Chang, a Director at a large telecommunications company, as he delves into popular culture to uncover common-sense leadership principles. Youll discover &lt;/p&gt;
 how to be a visionary like Optimus Prime, who surrounds himself
with Autobots who have a variety of skills;
 how to boost leadership skills by using your imagination like Calvin
from &lt;i&gt;Calvin and Hobbes&lt;/i&gt;
 what you can learn from the professional wrestlers who create public
personas that are extensions of their personalities;
 and many other case studies that teach valuable lessons, such as the
Incredible Hulk, G.I. Joe, Star Wars, and others.
&lt;p&gt;Develop the skills you need to build a team that works for you and have fun in the process with &lt;i&gt;Leadership: Its Not That Hard!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
