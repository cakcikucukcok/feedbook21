  <title>Serve to Be Great - Matt Tenney, Jon Gordon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Do you aspire to be a more effective leader who guides your team or organization to higher levels of lasting success? Would you like to look forward to each day and know that you are having a positive impact on the world around you?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is possible for everyone, regardless of your title or position. In fact, &lt;i&gt;Serve to Be Great: Leadership Lessons from a Prison, a Monastery, and a Boardroom&lt;/i&gt; will train you to make this a reality. Although it’s not an easy process, it is a worthwhile one.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By making a shift in your approach to leadership, you can become a highly effective leader who enjoys your work and makes the world a better place. The shift is simply a matter of gradually becoming more focused on how you can serve others and increase your capacity to do so. Being an extraordinary leader does not require a MBA or PhD. The reality is that anyone can be a great leader.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Author Matt Tenney has survived – and thrived – in situations where most people would have been quickly broken. In &lt;i&gt;Serve to Be Great&lt;/i&gt;, he offers his life experiences and unique insights to help leaders apply the powerful principles of servant leadership. Servant leaders are not weak or timid. Motivated by the aspiration to serve, they achieve true power by empowering others to achieve excellence.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is a practical guide to becoming a leader people want to follow. By shifting focus from short-term gain to serving others, leaders can create great workplace cultures that deliver superior, long-term results. &lt;i&gt;Serve to Be Great&lt;/i&gt; is the perfect playbook for realizing the ultimate in personal and business success.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In keeping with the spirit in which &lt;i&gt;Serve to Be Great&lt;/i&gt; was written, all author proceeds from the sale of the book will be donated to charity.&lt;/p&gt;" />
