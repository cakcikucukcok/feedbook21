  <title>Beyond the Bling : Real Steps to Financial Success - Patrick Borders, Donald Snider</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Don Snider&#39;s book,&quot;Beyond the Bling&quot; is a must read for anyone who is willing to take charge of his/her financial future.  Don narrates his life as an entrepreneur  while following closely the life of the Prophet Elijah at the Brook Cherith. His sole dependence on God&#39;s provisional nature is a refreshing view that should lead anyone to a renewed faith in God and the knowledge that he has an assigned place of blessing for us to experience and enjoy.  I highly recommend this book! &lt;P&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt; Bishop Alfred D. Knight Jr. &lt;br&gt;
Prelate Michigan Northwestern Harvest Jurisdiction
Church of God in Christ, Inc.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;P&gt; &lt;br&gt;
It is real spiritual wisdom, that properly applied will change your personal and professional lives. Don has captured real events and transformed them into life changing lessons that inspire action, spiritual  growth and prudent decision making &lt;P&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt; Lawrence Jackson &lt;BR&gt;
Managing Member of Emerging Enterprise Group, L.L.C. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Good book-great anecdotes for financial literacy. Catchy title that goes to the heart of todays consumerism. An easy read with real world understanding. I fully endorse. Should be on the coffee table of every American family. &lt;P&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt; Greg Jackson &lt;br&gt;
President/CEO Prestige Automotive &lt;/b&gt; &lt;P&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;With the keen insight of a scholar, the compelling voice of a biblical prophet, and the urgent compassion of a transformational business leader, Donald Snider focuses on a key issue that will benefit anyone who will listen to his sound advice. Anyone who wishes to succeed in life should read this book.&quot; &lt;P&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Founding Pastor, Resurrection Christian Center, Detroit, MI  &lt;/B&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Beyond the Bling, teaches a holistic approach to live in financial peace. 
Thank you Donald for a breakthrough to Economic Empowerment. &lt;P&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Wow !!!! &quot; Beyond The Bling&quot; is a modern day classic. Don Snider masterfully brought home the fact that true wealth is not about money. This book is a blue print for fiscal responsibility and a wonderful example of financial literacy. Beyond The Bling is the real thing. &lt;P&gt;&lt;br&gt;
