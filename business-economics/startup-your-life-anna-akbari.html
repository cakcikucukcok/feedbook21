  <title>Startup Your Life - Anna Akbari</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A young entrepreneur and sociologist shows readers how to reach personal fulfillment using the same strategies that power Silicon Valley&#39;s greatest startups.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an entrepreneur, Anna Akbari learned that one of the best things about startups is their ability to &quot;pivot&quot; quickly--basically a euphemism for failing and starting over. And she quickly found that personal success is no different.  It&#39;s not just about developing and following the right process but also having a good idea. And that demands rigor and daily maintenance--far beyond a few positive affirmations. Like any Silicon Valley startup, the business of life is not as glamorous as its Instagram account would make it seem. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What do you do when planning is not an option? When control is out of your reach? You isolate the small stuff, experiment constantly, and use the results to lay a more sustainable foundation for the future. You validate your idealized vision by testing it out in bite-sized increments. You see what sticks, integrate, and move forward. And inevitably, you experience a series of failures along the way, but those failures are key to your next success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Living a start up life is about maximizing flexibility and measuring on-going results, not avoiding failure or reaching one particular end goal. It&#39;s about embracing defeat, analyzing it, and failing up. In &lt;i&gt;Startup Your Life&lt;/i&gt;, Akbari shows that after all, it&#39;s often the stumbles that pave the way for real happiness.&lt;/p&gt;" />
