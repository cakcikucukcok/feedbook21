  <title>I, Light Bulb with Bonus eBook - Michael Patrick Leahy, Howard M. Brandston</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;New from Broadside Books&#39; Voices of the Tea Party. I&lt;em&gt;, Light Bulb: A Death Row Testimonial&lt;/em&gt; as told to Michael Patrick Leahy, demonstrates how the American economy has gone from free markets to politically correct, government controlled crony capitalism in the half century since Leonard E. Read wrote the classic essay I, Pencil. Leahy tells the story of the ban on the current generation of incandescents from the perspective of a condemned 100 watt light bulb. In the voice of the light bulb, Leahy points out the need for political activism to reverse this ban, arguing that it not onlyprevents an innocent incandescent light bulb from continuing a useful economic life, it also deprives every American of their own economic liberty and freedom of choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Readers who buy &lt;em&gt;I, Lightbulb&lt;/em&gt; will also receive the bonus companion e-book &lt;em&gt;The Disastrous Lightbulb Ban&lt;/em&gt; by Howard Brandston, at no additional cost. Brandston, the internationally recognized expert on lighting most well known for lighting the Statue of Liberty, explains why the federal government&#39;s ban on the current generation of incandescent light bulbs is such a bad idea. He explains how in 2007 a Democrat controlled Congress, the lamp manufacturers, the Department of Energy, and George W. Bush combined to force us to replace inexpensive and safe incandescent light bulbs with expensive, unsafe Compact Fluorescent Light bulbs that contain mercury. In this companion book to &lt;em&gt;I, Light Bulb,&lt;/em&gt; Brandston concludes by encouraging citizen political activism to repeal this ridiculous ban.&lt;/p&gt;" />
