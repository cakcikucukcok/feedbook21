  <title>Resolve and Fortitude - Joachim Kempin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is the story of a German-born executive, JK, who immigrated to the
United States to aid Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer, Microsofts top honchos
to build a commanding software empire. He led Microsofts OEM division
that was responsible for sales to PC manufacturers, and drove the deals
that made Microsoft Windows the worlds dominating operating system.&lt;br&gt;
Find out how much resolve, fortitude, and perseverance were needed
to make that part of the PC revolution come true; what strategies were
employed to win the Internet browser war; how IBM was beaten; what
drove Apple to the brink of disaster; and how shady politicians and hapless
competitors eventually goaded the Feds to ensnare Microsoft in a web of
antitrust accusations.&lt;br&gt;
Peek behind the curtain and be the first-ever outsider to glimpse into
Microsofts power nexus. Understand how Microsofts nearly mystical
marketing shrewdness and tech prowess are intensely propelled by
paranoia and fear of missing the next computing paradigm shift.&lt;br&gt;
The press labeled JK Bill Gatess enforcer. No wonder he was called
upon as a pivotal antitrust trial witness to defend what loathing competitors
labeled Microsofts evil empire. Follow what experts believe was the
most protracted, and fierce trial of the century. Relive the courtroom
drama, and read the authors critical analysis of the judicial proceedings
and their aftermaths.&lt;br&gt;
Losing that trial partially started Microsofts demise, and power struggles
from within quickened it. Get to know the real forces that altered
Microsofts resolve-and fortitude-dominated leadership style. Find out if
Windows 8 could be an inflection point, conjuring enough magic to ring
in a renaissance and attract the Facebook generation to a born-again
modern Microsoft." />
