  <title>Journal Your Way to Retirement - Joan Marie Gagnon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="If you picked up this book, you probably know the benefits of journaling or have been curious about it. If you dont have experience with journaling, you are in for a life-changing experience. I have been journaling on and off for twenty-five years. It has given me clarity on ideas, life, and love when I needed it.
You do not have to journal to benefit from this book.  Contemplating each question alone can generate the blissful retirement you desire.
Retiring from the workforce, from the daily routine you have known for many years, can be scary, exciting, frightening, calming, or paralyzing. This book will guide you through thought processes that may or may not have entered your mind as you begin to think of retirement several years away, or if you are fast approaching your last day in the workforce that you currently know. This book will also be helpful if you are retired, but just have not assimilated into your new life comfortably.
The subconscious and conscious minds are powerful resources that can give us exactly what we need to have a wonderful, joyous next phase of our life. By asking yourself powerful questions, the real truth will be revealed.  What you think and believe has a profound effect on your world.
The journal questions will bring you from how you are feeling today to how you want to feel when you are retired. It will help you blend the logical mind and your emotions. 
This book will not address in detail financial numbers, but will bring out into the open your feelings about your financial goals for retirement. Think of the journaling as a personal private conversation with yourself about retirement." />
