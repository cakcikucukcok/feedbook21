  <title>E-Girls Entrepreneurial Women - Sandra Turner Lemire</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This E-Girls Entrepreneurial Women guide comes from my personal experiences gained in starting nine businesses, including sole proprietorships, four corporations, and one limited liability company. I began my first business in 1979. I want to show women how they can start building their dream business wherever they are in their life. It is my goal to give them the advice they need to know as to where to start, how to dig deep to understand their goals, understand the potential earning power of their business ideas, how to change gears when things demand change, and how to avoid pitfalls. They need to incorporate a team of experts that provide them with knowledge that they may not currently have to keep them from wasting time and money. I present some of the real core issues that will help or hinder them, such as understanding and controlling credit, estate planning, business ownership, structures of different businesses, how to find what they need, traveling tips, and so forth. I encourage them to keep their own counsel and have faith in themselves and God. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I encourage women to reach out to other women either ahead of them in the journey or following in their footsteps, to reach back and give a helping hand to another woman coming in her shadow who needs an E-girlfriends encouragement to follow her own dream. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important key for all of this to come to fruition is their faith in God to make their dream happen. Their goal must be bigger than making money. They must have a drive to see a goal become reality, and it needs to be true in their hearts.&lt;/p&gt;" />
