  <title>The Four Faces of Sales - John Orvos</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Selling a service or a product is about closing deals. As a sales professional, if you dont close, youre not making any money for yourself or your company. But closing wont happen without an approach that makes you stand out from the thundering herd of competitionone that can make you more valuable in the eyes of the customer.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Four Faces of Sales&lt;/i&gt;, author John Orvos presents a unique, fresh, and practical approach to sales excellence. Drawn from his success as a sales leader in his own software company and from the years that followed, Orvos identifies, defines, and provides numerous examples of the four key steps, or faces, of salesthe sleuth, doctor, quarterback, and hero. His new sales approach facilitates success by building on whats known as personal value currency in the eyes of the customer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This guide goes beyond giving you the typical what to do and how to do it advice. The right skill used at the wrong time will not yield any better results than the wrong skill will. &lt;i&gt;The Four Faces of Sales&lt;/i&gt; explains what skills you need, teaches you how to execute these skills, and ensures you know precisely when to use them. You can create a positive, branded buying experience by taking the right actions at the right time.&lt;/p&gt;" />
