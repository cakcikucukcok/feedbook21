  <title>High Tech and High Touch - James E. Coverdill, William Finlay</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&quot;A must-read for anyone interested in careers and executives.&quot;—Peter Cappelli, author of &lt;I&gt; Talent on Demand&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt; &lt;I&gt;&quot;High Tech and High Touch&lt;/I&gt; tells a captivating story about how we are all such complicated creatures that not all jobs can be easily replaced by robots or search algorithms.&quot;—Ilana Gershon, editor of  &lt;I&gt;A World of Work&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&quot;As James E. Coverdill and William Finlay very convincingly argue, the role of headhunters is both undergoing transformation and deeply implicated in changing employment practices.&quot;—David Bills, author of  &lt;I&gt;The Sociology of Education and Work&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In  &lt;I&gt;High Tech and High Touch&lt;/I&gt;, James E. Coverdill and William Finlay invite readers into the dynamic world of headhunters, personnel professionals who acquire talent for businesses and other organizations on a contingent-fee basis. In a high-tech world where social media platforms have simplified direct contact between employers and job seekers, Coverdill and Finlay acknowledge, it is relatively easy to find large numbers of apparently qualified candidates. However, the authors demonstrate that headhunters serve a valuable purpose in bringing high-touch search into the labor market: they help parties on both sides of the transaction to define their needs and articulate what they have to offer.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;As well as providing valuable information for sociologists and economists,  &lt;I&gt;High Tech and High Touch&lt;/I&gt; demonstrates how headhunters approach practical issues such as identifying and attracting candidates; how they solicit, secure, and evaluate search assignments from client companies; and how they strive to broker interactions between candidates and clients to maximize the likelihood that the right people land in the right jobs.&lt;/P&gt;" />
