  <title>Lead with Courage - Arthur E. Puotinen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There is a leader in you and a leader in me. A poet writes, A lion paces in every human heart. What quickens yours? What makes your lion roar? Your courage can be unleashed to overcome fear, hunt for opportunities, and find resources for your group.
The fifteen main chapters in this book each describe:
	How lions live and survive in their natural habitat
	How leaders face challenges and crises, and learn from their shortcomings and success
	How leadership suggestions and lessons may be used in your own life and work
Each chapter also includes a bonus of several self-reflection topics for you to consider. This book narrates personal leadership experiences from my childhood up to retirement and examples from other leaders. The chapters relate the importance of courage in such formative experiences as:
	Family Life and Heritage
	School and College Experiences
	Teamwork and Partnership
	Courtship and Marriage
	Writing and Public Speaking
	Leading Groups and Organizations
	International Exchanges
	Fund Raising for Projects
	Financial Crises and Recovery
	Facing Cancer with Courage and Support
	Active Retirement" />
