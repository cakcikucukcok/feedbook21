  <title>101 things I wish I&#39;d known when I started using hypnosis - Dabney Ewin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&amp;#145;Always read the little book&amp;#8217; Charles Dunlap, MD. Dr Dunlap rolled a small library of about 30 books into his medical class and told them it was a monumental compilation of everything that was known about diabetes, published in 1920, before the discovery of insulin. He then held up a book of about 200 pages and said &amp;#145;this was published in 1930, after the discover of insulin. &amp;#145;Always read the little book&amp;#8217;. Dabney Ewin has been teaching medical hypnosis for the past thirty years and in his experience he believes that a small book is likely to be a clear message by a knowledgeable author. This simple but immensely powerful book is a testament to all the ideas that Dr Ewin wished he had known about when he first starting practising hypnosis. He has sought to make this publication as little as possible, consistent with the message of seeking to take a complicated idea and presenting it in the simplest way.The words and phrases are designed to give any beginning or experienced student a foundation about the working of hypnosis. Divided into five sections with a comprehensive reference section for further reading, this book can be taken one page at a time from the beginning or browsed through randomly.&lt;/div&gt;" />
