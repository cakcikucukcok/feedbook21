  <title>Paul for Everyone:The Prison Letters - Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians and Philemon (New Testament for Everyone) - Tom Wright</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Making use of his true scholar&amp;amp;#8217;s understanding, yet writing in an approachable and anecdotal style, Tom Wright captures the verve and sparkle of these letters. Paul wrote the letters while in prison facing possible death, but their passion and energy are undimmed. They reveal Paul&amp;amp;#8217;s longing to see young churches grow in faith and understanding, rooted in Jesus himself, and to see this faith worked out in practice &amp;amp;#8211; in one case, through the rehabilitation of a runaway slave. Wright&amp;amp;#8217;s stimulating comments are combined with his own translation of the Bible text.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" />
