    book is the resource that you need to get the job you want and deserve. It offers more than any treatise published on this subject, past or present.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Even if you are not contemplating a current career change, this book will assist you in knowing yourself, surfacing your professional passions, and
    increasing your confidence. If you are a hiring manager this book is an excellent resource to help you improve your hiring process to narrow your search
    for the best, most prepared candidates who will contribute to your success. Ive known Betty for many years. As a candidate I have personally benefitted
    from her wisdom, exacting preparation drills, and guidance. I am thrilled that she is making this wisdom available to everyone.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;
    Christina Hirsch, Sales Executive (CA)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    I recommend this book to anyone that is serious about their professional future: Bettys on-target complete guide will help you get that job you never
    dreamt possiblethat it is within your reach. She teaches you that building trust with her candidates and clients has helped her get the answers to
    questions most recruiters dont have. Betty helped me prepare far beyond the basic 10-question list by understanding Behavioral Questions that may be asked
    as well as making sure I was a cultural fit. Her follow-through throughout the process is 2nd to none throughout the whole interview process; it is a skill
    that Betty has turned into an art form.
