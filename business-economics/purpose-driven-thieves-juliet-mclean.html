  <title>Purpose Driven Thieves - Juliet McLean</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My book, Purpose Driven Thieves, is a nine year window into my life.  It is a true story of gross medical negligence by twenty-four neurosurgeons and radiologists who overlooked the cancer inside my spinal cord simply because I was born with a disease called Polands Syndrome and had previously had spinal surgery related to this condition.  This is a story of shocking lies, deceit, and incompetence all in the name of money, medicine controlled by the most corrupt of all world corporations  insurance.  It is a story that would be unbelievable if I did not have the doctors notes, MRIs etc, to substantiate it.   It is also a comparative analysis of the United States method of buying health insurance vs. the United Kingdoms method of buying healthcare based on the authors personal experience.  We, the patients, over the past five generations, have made doctors, pharmaceutical firms, and insurance companies, Purpose Driven Thieves." />
