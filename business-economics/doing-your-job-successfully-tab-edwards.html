      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Suppose that your employer or other stakeholder walked up to you today and asked you a simple question: &amp;ldquo;How will you succeed in your job?&amp;rdquo; Would you know the answer? What would you say to him or her?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are like many people in the workplace, chances are that whatever your answer, it is insufficient for achieving repeatable success in your job&amp;mdash;whatever your job happens to be. Success in any job requires an understanding of the levers of job-success and how the levers can impact your job performance; this, along with your ability, will decide your success in the job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Doing Your Job: Successfully&amp;rdquo; offers a prescription for how to succeed in your job. It establishes a framework for understanding why some workers are highly successful in their jobs, why others are unsuccessful, and the differences between the work habits and conditions of each of these sets of workers. Put differently, this book shows you how to perform your job ... successfully.&lt;/p&gt;" />
