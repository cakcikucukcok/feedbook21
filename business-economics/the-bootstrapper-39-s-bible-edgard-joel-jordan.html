  <title>The Bootstrapper&#39;s Bible - Edgard Joel Jordan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Discover 43 Ideas For Businesses You Can Start Today!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Job security is at an all-time low in America and many other parts of the world &amp;ndash; sometimes it feels like the only company you can trust is the one that you start yourself!&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Add that to the fact that the power of the Internet has not only greatly democratized the economy and lowered the barrier to entry for a lot of people, but has opened up whole new industries, and you&amp;#39;ve got a pretty compelling case to strike out on your own.&lt;br /&gt;
Whether you&amp;#39;re transitioning from an old career into a new one, facing the all-too-familiar struggle to stay at home with the kids and remain productive, or retiring and looking for what&amp;#39;s next, a business and a home-based business is a great opportunity.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Starting one is within reach for just about anybody who&amp;#39;s willing to take on the risk and work hard.&lt;br /&gt;
If you&amp;#39;re sure you want to get started, but don&amp;#39;t know how to get started, then continue reading on.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Here&amp;#39;s what you&amp;#39;ll discover in the Promote Tactics guide:&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;You&amp;#39;ll find are 43 ideas for businesses that you can begin building today without a huge amount of capital.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;When you encounter one that resonates with you, you&amp;#39;ll find some useful information on that particular business to help you decide whether or not it&amp;#39;s the right one for you.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Each idea and business is organized neatly for easy reading.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;You&amp;#39;ll find out the average income for each business and what qualifications are required (if any).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;These 43 ideas are businesses where you can offer services all the way to online businesses.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;...and much, much more!&lt;/li&gt;
