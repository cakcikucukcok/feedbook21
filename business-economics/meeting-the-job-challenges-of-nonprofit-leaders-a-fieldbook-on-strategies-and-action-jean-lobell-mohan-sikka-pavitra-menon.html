  <title>Meeting the Job Challenges of Nonprofit Leaders: A Fieldbook on Strategies and Action - Jean Lobell, Mohan Sikka, Pavitra Menon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Nonprofit organizations need to depend on mission-oriented, motivated, and committed leaders who have a mix of social awareness, programmatic expertise, operational knowledge and skills, strong relationship capacities, and sound judgment to deliver results in an environment in which they must function and fulfill their missions with very limited resources while simultaneously demonstrating the impact of every dollar they raise.Community Resource Exchange, a management consulting firm that works with nonprofit organizations of all sizes, delivers leadership and management programs designed to build the competencies of nonprofit leaders. This fieldbook aims to put many of the skills and insights gained by participants in CRE&#39;s cohort learning programs into the hands of more nonprofit leaders.The strategies offered here will provide nonprofit leaders with approaches to their challenges that shift their perspective on things or stretch their current repertoire of practices and competencies. Applying these approaches are developmental experiences, enabling nonprofit leaders to supplement or deepen their leadership talent. By implementing the suggested approaches, nonprofit leaders will learn by doing, a key ingredient in adult learning." />
