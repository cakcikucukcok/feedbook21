  <title>How to Create, Establish and Repair My Credit - Octavio Ponce</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;It is important to familiarize ourselves with our credit report and have it close to maintain it in good standing and take advantage of it the most we can. The credit report is not the loan institutions responsibility nor financial institutions or banks that are the ones that utilize it to decide under which terms they approve the loan; the credit report is each individuals responsibility.
You would think that if you bought everything in cash, then you would never need a loan or any kind of financing, and you would not have to familiarize yourself with what is credit, but allow me to tell you that the credit report is not utilized or analyzed only for people that ask for loans. The credit report affects a lot of other factors in your daily life, like how your auto insurance, your work, your position at your job, and your rent, in fact, affect your daily life.
That is why I repeat that credit is one of the tools mostly utilized in actuality. 
Learn how to utilize it in your favor, and obtain all the benefits that it gives youa good management of your credit report.&lt;i/&gt;
In todays market, there has not been a BOOK that has put together all the three elements of the CREDIT HISTORY: Create, Establish, and Repair. This is a one-of-a-kind BOOK. 
There is the hunger and the need for information that helps all people with their credit report, and this BOOK is a powerful tool in the hands of whoever buys it and reads it." />
