In &lt;i&gt;Making It in Management,&lt;/i&gt; Lawrence Anderson provides advice to ensure success for middle managers and middle-managers-to-be.
Anderson, a seasoned organization change consultant with more than thirty years of experience, seeks to help managers looking for an edge to move them up the career ladder toward top management. Through anecdotes gained from on-the-job experience, he outlines three key areas:
	Where managers fit into the organization, the purpose of the organization, and the key roles that need to be executed
	What credible managers have to know and do to maintain the organizations health
	How middle managers can enhance their career mobility by finding a good mentor, managing the boss, getting the best from consultants, and managing mind thoughts
&lt;i&gt;Making It in Management&lt;/i&gt; helps managers develop the kind of thinking they need to move up the corporate ladder and stay at the top." />
