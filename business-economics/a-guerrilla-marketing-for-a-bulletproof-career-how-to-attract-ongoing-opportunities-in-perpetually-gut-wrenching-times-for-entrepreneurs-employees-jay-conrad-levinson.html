  <title>a Guerrilla Marketing for a Bulletproof Career: How to Attract Ongoing Opportunities in Perpetually Gut Wrenching Times, for Entrepreneurs, Employees - Jay Conrad Levinson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Guerrilla Marketing for a Bulletproof Career is the most honest, practical, and hard-hitting guide ever written for people who want to &quot;bullet-proof&quot; their career and succeed in perpetually uncertain times. It provides a road map to advance one&#39;s career without being blindsided by overnight industry collapses, potential layoffs, economic shocks, corporate scandals, or technological disruptions. Readers of this book will never again have to worry about financial peace of mind or job security, because they will have a new set of strategies for success in a new and continually evolving economy. This applies equally to business owners--who need to plan for extreme volatility in the market and to recognize that their career is likely to extend beyond owning a single company--and to employees, who can be laid off at any time." />
