  <title>Skilled Dialogue - Isaura Barrera, Lucinda Kramer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ever needed to communicate or even collaborate with someone who just didnt agree with you or see things as you did? Think theres only two options: their way to your way? Barrera and Kramer propose a third option inclusive of both ways. They present an approach that goes beyond both-and to arrive at a third option: Skilled Dialogue, a field-tested series of strategies that can transform contradictory interactions into complementary ones.
Readers will learn how to
	build mutually complementary relationships that honor difference
	access and mine the strengths of differences
	explore multiple ways of creating mutually satisfying options without the need for compromise
	apply the six Skilled Dialogue strategies in ways that generate respect (i.e., honor identity), reciprocity (i.e., honor voice) and responsiveness (i.e., honor connection)
Case examples and sample scenarios allow readers to practice what theyve learned and provide them with models for their own interactions. An invaluable resource for all who interact across differences, whether professionally or personally, this book will help readers to resolve interactional challenges in ways that allow differences to enhance outcomes rather than detract from them." />
