PREVIEW: Nick Ortner&#39;s The Tapping Solution: A Revolutionary System for Stress-Free Living presents the basic principles and practice of tapping. Tapping, or Emotional Freedom Techniques (EFT), is a system for relieving emotional and physical stress and illness. Tapping is based on principles of Chinese acupuncture and Western psychology. It can quickly and effectively eliminate anxiety, phobias, pain, and many physical illnesses.
Tapping was developed by Dr. Robert Callahan and his student Gary Craig beginning in 1979. It is based on the meridian points used in acupuncture. Meridians are energy channels for the body&#39;s life force. Meridians have end points on the body&#39;s surface, which can be manipulated with needles or fingers to unblock energy flows." />
