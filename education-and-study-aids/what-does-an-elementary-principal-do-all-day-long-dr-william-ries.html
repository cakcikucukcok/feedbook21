  <title>What Does an Elementary Principal Do All Day Long? - Dr. William Ries</title>
      <meta name="description" content="WHAT DOES AN ELEMENTARY PRINCIPAL DO ALL DAY LONG?
Dr. William Ries is one of a limited number of school administrators who have considerable experience within both the public school system and the Catholic school system of our country.
A veteran of the Korean War, Dr. Ries chose the field of education over a possible baseball career.
He began his career in Cincinnatis inner city as a teacher of Physical Education, eventually being promoted to the principal ship and staying with the public schools for 22 years.  
Upon retirement, Dr. Ries unexpectedly was hired within The Archdiocese of Cincinnati and remained as principal for another 15 years.  
Is there a difference in running a public school versus a Catholic school?  
Read his exciting, sometimes controversial, sometimes humorous, but never boring account of managing within both school systems.
Dr. Ries is retired from education.  He enjoys reading, playing senior softball, senior volleyball, a card game called Hearts,  biking and watching his 7 grandchildren participate in basketball, football, soccer and lacrosse games." />
