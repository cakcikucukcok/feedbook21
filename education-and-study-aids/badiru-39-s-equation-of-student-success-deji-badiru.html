  <title>Badiru&#39;s Equation of Student Success - Deji Badiru</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book presents a compilation of the authors techniques used over a 30-year teaching career for mentoring, encouraging, and chastising (when needed) his students to elicit better performance from each student. The techniques often involve a combination of tender loving care, when deserved, and stern hard-nosed approach (when warranted). 
The book presents the authors famous equation of success, the dreaded recipe for an F, and general guide for time management. The book is purposely designed to be brief and to the point to encourage readers read-through. Although the book focuses on university education, the guidance is equally applicable to high school students as well. Badirus equation of success is a guide for encouragement and mentorship rather than a book of indictment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book presents a personal management approach to student success. The proven techniques of formal project management are recommended as effective approaches to achieving the objectives of student success. The book is deliberately written in an informal list-oriented style to facilitate ease of reference. The book is intended to assist both students and instructors in the pursuit of the activities necessary for satisfactory completion of college education. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pursuit of college education is an individual matter, buttressed by the support of the family and the academic institution. It is the responsibility of the student to take the appropriate action at the appropriate time.&lt;/p&gt;" />
