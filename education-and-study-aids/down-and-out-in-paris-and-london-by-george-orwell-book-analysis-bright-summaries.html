It is a memoir in two parts on the theme of poverty in the two cities, which was written deliberately in a non-academic tone. Its target audience was the middle and upper class members of society—those who were more likely to be well educated—and exposes the poverty existing in two prosperous cities: Paris and London.<br /><b><i>Down and Out in Paris and London - Wikipedia</i></b> | Living Down and Out in Paris and London, repudiating respectable imperialist society, and reinventing himself as George Orwell. His 1933 debut book (ostensibly a novel, but overwhelmingly autobiographical) was rejected by that elitist publisher T.S. Eliot, perhaps because its close-up portrait of lowlife was too pungent for comfort.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Down and Out in Paris and London by George Orwell (Book Analysis) - Bright Summaries</a> </h3></p><hr/>
