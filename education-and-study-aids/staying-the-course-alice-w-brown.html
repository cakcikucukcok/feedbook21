  <title>Staying the Course - Alice W. Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Staying the Course is about a college that many describe as being  the way colleges used to be: beautiful, well-maintained buildings and grounds; caring, capable faculty; administrators who manage frugally and compassionately; a bright, energetic president willing to dedicate his life to assuring a solid future for the institution; and students who study hard and work hard to serve those in need.  Still the college struggles to maintain what it has built and to increase its endowment, small by comparison to many private institutions, at the same time it continues to hold tuition low and provide funding to students who, even with Pell grants, need extra help to go to and stay in college.  How the college is managing to build a sustainable financial base is described in chapters focusing on the kinds of students who attend, the faculty who teach, the administrators who oversee the multiple programs that support the students as well as design new courses and new ways of teaching, the trustees who guide the college, and the president who has stayed long enough to see many of his dreams for the college realized, to shape new dreams and to raise the funding that makes those dreams realities. The college still struggles in many ways but its struggles are far less than they would be without the lessons the institution has learned and is offering to other small, private colleges facing similar difficult circumstances.  With the many stories about the sad state of higher education today, this book contradicts those stories with its description of how merging the values of the past with the information and strategies available today can enable a small college in a region of poverty and with a population of students with limited financial resources to rise above those threats and limitations to become a model for the future of such institutions." />
