  <title>The Adventures of Ajalon &amp; Kayla - Shereece Connolly-McLeish</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sometimes young readers find it hard when they finish reading a good book to say goodbye to the characters they have become attached to.  Teachers can give the students a chance to talk about what made the book so wonderful.  How can they relate to the characters?  How did the book made them feel?  If the book is a series, what do they expect in the next book?  Children can create a scrapbook based on the book and add pages to it as they read more books in the series.  
The scrapbook can include illustrations and comments about the characters, who they believe is their favorite character, and what made the book enjoyable.  They can share the scrapbook, compare it with the scrapbooks of other classmates, or they can simply keep it as their own journal on the series." />
