  <title>Heart of Conferring - Jennifer Wessberg, Tanya M. Pfeiffer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Weve all read or heard somewhere that our students are supposed to be reading for a large part of our readers workshop. But, what do we do when they are reading? How do we do conferring in a way that is manageable and effective for our students?  How do we know if Sarah chose an appropriate book? How do we know if the little boy who loves non-fiction isnt just staring at the cool pictures? What should a child do after the conference? The Heart Of Conferring delivers a commonsense approach to all these questions and more. This book provides a structure and a roadmap to the fourth part of our readers workshop (read aloud, shared reading, guided reading, independent reading/conferring), the part that is most often overlooked. Conferring; The Heart of Conferring, written by two everyday teachers, takes the reader on a journey through the essential steps of the conferring process in the readers workshop. This book provides the everyday, working teacher with dialogue from real reading conferences, the benefits of why we do this, and the ever allusive how to confer effectively and keep it going all year long. This book will be enlightening to any teacher who confers, wants to confer or has tried and stopped. It will be an effective tool for the seasoned veteran or the first year teacher. Join us on our journey through the Heart of Conferring." />
