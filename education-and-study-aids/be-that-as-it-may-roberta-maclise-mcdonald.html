  <title>Be That as It May! - Roberta Maclise McDonald</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Parents of school children frustrated and confused by the way the public school system seems to shut them out of any meaningful contribution to the education of their children should find this book informative and very helpful. The author recounts many of her experiences in the Public Education System from the inside  where she taught in a wide variety of places and grades throughout Western Canada, over a period of  46 years. She recounts the many changes that have taken place in that time frame.
Roberta (as she prefers to be called) prides herself on the courage to face  difficulties head on and challenge authority when it appears to be self-serving rather than dedicated to its founding principles. This pursuit has led her to run for public office three times and enter several other fields, some in the private sector, which gives her a different perspective than souly as a public servant. The topics covered range from new trends since the end of W.W. II to whether uniforms should be instituted to what can be done about bullying. Many authorities are quoted and brought into the discussion from Statistics Canada to Hilda Neatby. 
Education is a hot button topic these days, second only to Health Care in Canada it seems. Roberta wonders whether we are due for some real fundamental changes in the way we teach our children. This book encourages us to open a true dialectic on the subject." />
