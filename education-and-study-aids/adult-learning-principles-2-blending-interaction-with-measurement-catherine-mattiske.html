  <title>Adult Learning Principles 2: Blending Interaction with Measurement - Catherine Mattiske</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the world of training and development, the subject of measuring return on investment (ROI) is discussed frequently. Organizations everywhere are searching for the perfect measurement system to link human resource capability with the business strategy. Organizations pay for their people to attend training and in return they expect to see learning goals achieved. They also expect that learning outcomes will have a positive impact on the bottom-line. To achieve this result, it is important to understand how learning can be effectively measured in the classroom. It is during the training itself that we have the first opportunity to observe learning transfer taking place. If this can be managed and measured in the classroom, then there is real opportunity to measure workplace application and contribution to organizational results.This Learning Short-take™ combines self-study with workplace activities to develop skills in learning measurement. Participants will examine the importance of ROI in training and explore common myths around learning measurement. Participants will learn practical tools and develop new and innovative strategies to assess learning in the classroom.The Learning Short-take™ is designed for completion in approximately 90 minutes.Learning Objectives• Explain the importance of ROI (Return on Investment) in training.• Identify common myths about measuring training in the classroom.• Explain Kirkpatrick&#39;s Learning Evaluation Model.• Explain the value of Review as a solid training measurement• Describe the various types of Reviews.• Identify and explain the different levels of Review.• Create a Skills Development Action Plan." />
