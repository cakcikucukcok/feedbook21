  <title>The Day It Rained Chocolate Milk! - Stacy Spriggs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;The Day it Rained Chocolate Milk! is inspired by my own children&#39;s relentless love for chocolate milk. They drink it everyday, resulting in countless trips to the store to get more syrup or milk when we inevitably run out. I thought, &quot;it would be so nice to have an endless supply of it.&quot;  
This book is intended to target a preschool/ early elementary audience. It is an imaginative, silly adventure that all children will enjoy. The story line introduces multiple cognitive concepts, including an understanding that actions involve consequences. Underlying themes such as water quality pollution and healthy nutritional choices are woven into the tale.  
The story involves an unusual rainstorm that showers down chocolate milk rather than water. At first, this seems exciting and fun. But, the children involved soon realize that this milk is creating havoc in certain situations. For instance, fish are having trouble breathing and drivers can&#39;t see out of their windshields. Soon, the children&#39;s father comes up with a creative solution to restore everything to normal." />
