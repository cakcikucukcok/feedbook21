      <meta name="description" content="Despite a current trend toward individuality and cultural disparity, the fact remains that we have powerful tools that unite us all &amp;ndash; our collective imagination, hunger for explanations, and the artistic images that they inspire. Irrespective of geographical location or industrial advancement, people from every corner of the globe cling to the myths, legends and stories that have organized and continue to organize whole societies, dictated religious and moral ideologies, and explained the mysteries of the universe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Museographs&amp;#39; Art, Myth, Legend and Story invites you to indulge your mythic side! Develop a better understanding of the origins and purposes of these beloved creations, and familiarize yourself with the themes and characters that make them possible. Meet Tiddalik, the Australian frog who was so thirsty he drank all the water in the land, leaving nothing for his creature friends. The White Serpent, one of the most popular surviving Chinese legends, or taste Forbidden Fruit with an African tale that explains the origin of the serpent found in creation accounts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Peruse bold images such as Herakles on a Greek vase, the life-giving Toltec rain god, Tlaloc, and Benjamin West&amp;#39;s painting, Noah Sacrificing After the Deluge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This issue is as visually striking as it is textually informative. It consolidates and impressive selection of cross-cultural myths, legends and stories accompanied by relevant and powerful images. As an integral reference tool or as a beautiful compendium for the art and story enthusiast, it supplies a list of additional myths, legends, stories, and artistic renderings found in other volumes of the Museographs collection." />
