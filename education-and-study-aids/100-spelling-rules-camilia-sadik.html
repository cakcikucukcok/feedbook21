  <title>100 Spelling Rules - Camilia Sadik</title>
      <meta name="description" content="100 Spelling Rules contains exclusive 100 spelling rules discovered by Linguist Camilia Sadik. Logical learners need these rules to know when to spell a sound one-way and not the other, as in the final sound in fashion, ocean, suspicion, complexion, superstition, expression, and musician. 100 Spelling Rules is for the advanced level and advanced children or adults are guaranteed to learn to spell hundreds of words at a time and gain fluency in reading aloud.   Advanced students are those who finished learning the 13,000 essential words from the book entitled &quot;Learn to Spell 500 Words a Day,&quot; which is for the intermediate level.   100 Spelling Rules contains 12,000 long words and most of the lessons in it are to learn word endings (suffixes), and one must know how to spell the vowels and consonants inside words before learning to spell word endings.   100 Spelling Rules is a comprehensive book of the rules that govern phonics and word endings. Its 105 detailed spelling lessons cover nearly all of the questions that can be asked about when to spell an English sound one-way and not the other.   All words of same sound and same spelling pattern, which follow a specific rule, are grouped together and prepared for students to read aloud and learn.   Rules alone do not teach spelling; thus, Sadik applied the spelling rules in 600 phonics lessons in 10 books. Children and adults are guaranteed to read and spell hundreds of words at a time from these 10 phonics and spelling books.   Vowels rule English and they cannot be avoided. Without the practice lessons of the vowels books, the book 100 Spelling Rules may teach the rules but not the actual spelling of words. Learning to spell requires learning phonics as they are used in the vowels books.   Each vowel is isolated in a book. For instance, the vowel &quot;a&quot; has five sounds we call phonics, which are spelled in 12 spelling patterns. Every sound and spelling pattern of the vowel &quot;a&quot; is presented in The Vowel A book, as in these examples [Long a: may, main, ate, eight, table, break] [Short a: man] [Special sounds of a: fall, false, author, awe, warn] [Schwa sound of a: permanent]   100 Spelling Rules can be used by teachers and parents of K-12, adult literacy centers, dyslexic persons who can read but cannot spell, and advanced ESL students.   Learning phonics means learning which letter or combination of letters to choose when spelling every English sound in every English word. These 10 phonics books teach reading and the spelling of nearly all of the combinations of letters and the letters that do not sound like their letter name in 32,000 words.   The 30 unique learning features used in the books make learning to spell inescapable; all words are divided into syllables, all silent letters are italicized, every spelling pattern of a sound is bolded and colored, every lesson begins with a spelling rule, grouping of words, and each vowel is isolated in a book, etc.   Dyslexia in spelling and in writing letters in reverse ends, after learning to spell and after slowing down to write words slowly.   Other Phonics and Spelling Books by Camilia Sadik are: 1. Read Instantly, which is a book to teach phonics. Anyone capable of learning the ABC&#39;s is guaranteed to learn to read instantly. Read Instantly is for beginners, but all learners need to start with it to learn phonics in a brand-new way.   2. Learn to Spell 500 Words a Day is a book in six volumes. The titles of the six volumes are The Vowel A, The Vowel E, The Vowel I, The Vowel O, The Vowel U, and The Consonants.   3. 100 Spelling Rules   4. The compound Words: Over 7,000 Compound &amp; Hyphenated words are isolated in this book, grouped alphabetically, colored, and prepared for children and adults to read and learn.   5. How to Teach Phonics: Teachers&#39; Guide is a guide with instructions to teach or to learn from the 10 phonics books." />
