  <title>What the Health - Eunice Wong, Keegan Kuhn, Kip Andersen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What The Health&lt;/em&gt; is the official, stand-alone companion book to the groundbreaking documentary of the same name, directed by Kip Andersen and Keegan Kuhn, directors of the award-winning documentary,&lt;em&gt; Cowspiracy: The Sustainability Secret&lt;/em&gt;. If the film is a peephole, then this book knocks down the entire door, diving into expanded interviews, extensive research, and personal narratives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;     Scientific literature shows that eating saturated fatmainly found in animal products like meat, dairy, and eggsis &lt;em&gt;more strongly associated with death than smoking cigarettes&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;     Think about that. If, at a neighborhood cookout, the dad next door offered youand your childa cigarette and a light, how would you react? And yet we accept, with thanks, the glistening beef burgers from that same dad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;     Whats the difference between taking the cigarette and the burger? The smell and the taste. The social assumptions. The habits. The lack of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;     Journey with Kip and Keegan as they crisscross the country, talking to physicians, dietitians, cardiologists, pediatricians, bariatric surgeons, lawyers, economists, activists, and food safety advocates in a passionate search for the truth about the food we eat, and the stunning implications for our health and the countrys cascade of killer diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;     Along the way they meet Ren Miller, whose home is routinely drenched by manure cannons from the factory farm next door; slaughterhouse vet Dr. Lester Friedlander who blew the whistle on Mad Cow Disease; political prisoner Jake Conroy; and world-class athletes like former NFL-defensive lineman David Carter and ultra-endurance athlete Rich Roll, who completed 5 Ironman triathlons in under a week, and many other fascinating characters, each with their own piece of the puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;     There is a health revolution brewing. Many people know theres something terribly broken about the industrial food, medical, and pharmaceutical systems, but they dont know what it is. Its no wonder, because there is an intricate political and corporate apparatus in place to keep them from finding out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;     People think heart disease, cancer, and diabetes are inherited, not realizing that what theyve actually inherited are the eating habits of their parents and grandparents. Lifestyle choices like diet and (lack of) exercise are responsible for about 70 percent of deaths in this country. Diseases that kill millions can be prevented, or even reversed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;     What The Health&lt;/em&gt; takes you on an adventure, uncovering the lethal entwining of the food, medical, and pharmaceutical industries with our own government, and the corporate, legislative web designed to confuse the public and keep Americans chronicallyand profitablyill.&lt;/p&gt;" />
