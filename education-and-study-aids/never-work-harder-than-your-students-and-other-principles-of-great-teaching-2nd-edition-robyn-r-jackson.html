She answers questions, shares stories from her own practice and work with other teachers, and provides all-new, empowering advice on navigating external evaluation. There&#39;s even a self-assessment to help you identify your current levels of mastery and take control of your own practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teaching is hard work, and great teaching means doing the right kind of hard work: the kind that pays off. Join tens of thousands of teachers around the world who have embarked on their journeys toward mastery. Discover for yourself the difference that Jackson&#39;s principles will make in your classroom and for your students.&lt;/p&gt;" />
