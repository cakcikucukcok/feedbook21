  <title>New Easy Original Piano / Keyboard Music - Beginners - Intermediate (2nd Edition) - Martin Woodward</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The object of this book has been to produce a collection of original pieces (composed by the author) which are both easy and satisfying to play. I hope I&#39;ve succeeded. I certainly enjoy playing all of them.  The 16 original compositions in this collection range from moderately easy to intermediate, but certainly not difficult. Although I have indicated this in the overview they are not featured in any particular order of how difficult they are. In relation to the Associated Board grades, I would rate these pieces at between grades 1 to 5. All except one have been written with a &#39;chord line&#39; so that they can alternatively be played easily using an electronic keyboard with auto accompaniment. Additionally, many of the pieces can be played on a four or five octave keyboard. Listen Before you Buy. All of the pieces can be heard in the link in the free preview of this book, please listen to these before purchasing - if you don&#39;t like them you&#39;ll not have to bother buying it! But I think you&#39;ll like them!" />
