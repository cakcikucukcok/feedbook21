  <title>The Blind Advantage - Bill Henderson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;I&gt;The Blind Advantage&lt;/I&gt; provides insight into the challenges, possibilities, and practicalities of including students with disabilities&amp;mdash;and into the mind and heart of an inspired and determined leader.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;ldquo;You should get out of education.&amp;rdquo;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt; That was the advice first-year teacher Bill Henderson received when he discovered he was gradually losing his vision. Instead, Henderson persevered and became principal of the Patrick O&amp;rsquo;Hearn Elementary School in Boston, an ethnically and economically diverse school where about a third of the students have mild, moderate, or significant disabilities.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt; In &lt;I&gt;The Blind Advantage,&lt;/I&gt; Henderson describes how the journey into blindness helped him develop key qualities&amp;mdash;determination, vision, sensitivity, organization, collaboration, and humor&amp;mdash;that made him a more effective principal. At the same time, he shows how the inclusionary policies and practices at the O&amp;rsquo;Hearn School (now renamed the William W. Henderson Inclusion Elementary School) elicited and developed these qualities in others.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt; An audio version of this book is available for purchase.
