  <title>Philosophy of Motivation - Leon Kabasele</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I wrote Philosophy of Motivation for the reader to understand motivation and the importance of being self-motivated. Many authors have written books about philosophy, but few of them have written about practical philosophy. This book explains how philosophy of motivation can help somebody be self-motivated in real life. Being motivated does not show in ones appearance; it is about helping each other and learning from each other. As long as we are thinking of our dreams, we can benefit other people and motivate ourselves as well. Everybody has the ability to help other people, and doing favours for others will make one feel better as well. 
Through my research, I discovered that when there are many philosophers, there will be many different ideas as well. So there will be as many philosophers as there are philosophies. In this book, I discuss many points that can help communities and entire countries be motivated in everything that they do. I encourage readers to be filled with motivation because dreams cannot be allowed to die, even when contrary philosophical concepts come to destroy them. I believe that every human being has a talent, for nobody was created by mistake. Somebodys talent can be dependent on the environment where the person lives. I personally like this book because I felt motivated when writing it. I believe that being self-motivated is the key to success and achieving a good goal. The reader will understand that happiness does not mean winning a lottery but achieving ones dream." />
