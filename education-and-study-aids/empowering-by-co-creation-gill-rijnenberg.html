  <title>Empowering by Co-Creation - Gill Rijnenberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Gill Rijnenberg is the founder of the WINS Foundation, which he initiated in 2004 as a small private project.
WINS has now evolved into a global non-profit charity organization, which goal is to provide unprivileged children of Indonesia the opportunity to obtain education, so that they can break the cycle of poverty.
The WINS mission is not just to raise funds, and send as many children to school, but it is to let them become self-sufficient and responsible for their own future.
To achieve that goal, WINS is setup as a ‘leaderless’ organization, co-created by all people involved.
This book tells the story of the WINS project, how it was initiated and how the children that joined the program thirteen years ago, are now the managing teams of their Learning Centers. 
The path of the co-creation of WINS was filled with many mystical coincidences. And as coincidences don&#39;t exist, it shows us that there were other metaphysical energies supporting this project and that there is more between heaven an earth.." />
