  <title>Catch-22 by Joseph Heller (Book Analysis) - Bright Summaries</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Unlock the more straightforward side of &lt;i&gt;Catch-22&lt;/i&gt; with this concise and insightful summary and analysis!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This engaging summary presents an analysis of &lt;i&gt;Catch-22&lt;/i&gt; by Joseph Heller, a highly complex novel which brings together a wide range of characters and seemingly random, jumbled episodes in a non-linear timeline. However, the plot is anchored in the character of Yossarian, a bombardier in the Air Forces who spends the novel constantly searching for a way to be dismissed from the military, usually on grounds of insanity, only to be perpetually rebuffed by his superiors due to a paradoxical bureaucratic loophole known as Catch-22. This satirical novel about the deep psychological scars left by the trauma of war was heavily inspired by Heller&#39;s own experiences as a soldier during the Second World War, and is generally considered his masterpiece.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Find out everything you need to know about &lt;i&gt;Catch-22&lt;/i&gt; in a fraction of the time!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;This in-depth and informative reading guide brings you:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;oA complete plot summary&lt;br&gt;oCharacter studies&lt;br&gt;oKey themes and symbols&lt;br&gt;oQuestions for further reflection&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Why choose BrightSummaries.com?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Available in print and digital format, our publications are designed to accompany you on your reading journey.
