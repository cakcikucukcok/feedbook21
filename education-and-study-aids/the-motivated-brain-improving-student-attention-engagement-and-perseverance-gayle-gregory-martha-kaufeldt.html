  <title>The Motivated Brain: Improving Student Attention, Engagement, and Perseverance - Gayle Gregory, Martha Kaufeldt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What really motivates students to learn? What gets them interested-and keeps them interested-in pursuing knowledge and understanding? Recent neuroscientific findings have uncovered the source of our motivation to learn, or as neuroscientist Jaak Panksepp terms it, the drive &lt;em&gt;to seek&lt;/em&gt;. Seeking is what gets us out of bed in the morning, the engine that powers our actions, and the need that manifests as curiosity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Informed by new findings on the nature of the brain&#39;s seeking system, internationally renowned educators Gayle Gregory and Martha Kaufeldt have identified key brain-friendly strategies for improving student motivation, knowledge acquisition, retention, and academic success. In this book, readers will learn&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; * The science behind the motivated brain and how it relates to student learning.&lt;br /&gt; * Strategies for preparing a motivational environment and lesson.&lt;br /&gt; * Strategies for creating engaging learning experiences that capitalize on the brain&#39;s natural ways of learning.&lt;br /&gt; * Strategies for improving depth of knowledge, complex thinking, and synthesis to get students into the ever-desired state of flow.&lt;br /&gt; * How attention to the neuroscience of motivation will improve the classroom environment and student learning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;em&gt;The Motivated Brain&lt;/em&gt; shows teachers how to harness the power of their students&#39; intrinsic motivation to make learning fun, engaging, and meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;" />
