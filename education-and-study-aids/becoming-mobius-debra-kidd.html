  <title>Becoming Mobius - Debra Kidd</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Becoming Mobius is about living with uncertainty. Uncertainty is a state of being that many people struggle with both in day-to-day life and in education; being uncertain has almost become a sin. If we are truly to have an education system that &#39;works&#39;, we need to accept that learning and life are not simple, and we need to engage with difficult and complex ideas. Focusing on the process of learning and teaching, Dr Debra Kidd posits the possibility that wondering and wandering teachers might impact greatly on a child&#39;s ability to live with and thrive among uncertainties. She asks of us, not only as teachers or researchers, but simply as human beings, what are the things that affect us, and how can we remain attuned to all their possibilities while still functioning? Taking cues from neuroscience, physics, anthropology and philosophy, particularly that of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, but also Hannah Arendt, Jacques Derrida, Michel Foucault and others, Dr Kidd explores the nature and purpose of education through a series of different lenses. Details, moments, interactions and relationships are put under the microscope and their effects on teaching and learning examined. Becoming Mobius started life as Debra Kidd&#39;s doctoral thesis and draws on her extensive classroom experience, her own observations and research, and a broad base of educational thought; including the work of Gert Biesta, Masny&#39;s Multiple Literacies and more. In Becoming Mobius each chapter is presented as a plateau and maps the complexities of teaching and learning. This is a journey through a landscape of education. It is not a straight route. It is not a cop-out. It is a means of living in, with and through complexity and multiplicity. It is an attempt to bring forward a fresh vision of education. This is an honest, challenging and incredibly profound book that makes you stop and think - deeply - about what you do, why you do it and the effect it has. You will never look at teaching in the same light again. For anyone interested in thinking deeply about education." />
