  <title>Teaching Learning - Sid Jacobson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Since the 1970s, educators, psychologists and politicians have continually stressed the need to help children actually learn how to learn. This groundbreaking book is the first of its kind to do just that. Aimed at parents who want to start their kids off on the right track, this book is actually a step-by-step course to help you teach your kids how to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its filled with explanations, exercises, tips, check lists and guidelines to help you at every step in the process. Your kids wont learn these things in school, because schools arent equipped to provide it. Here is your chance to make up for whats missing in the classroom. You wont find anything like it anywhere else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THIS BOOK IS GREAT! Sid has written what may be the definitive guide for parents (... and anyone else who works with children). He literally covers it all: how to prepare yourself, the most important things you need to pay attention to when you are working with children to help them succeed...&lt;/p&gt;
-Joseph Riggio, Ph.D., Cognitive Scientist,&lt;/br&gt;
author of &lt;i&gt;The State of Perfection&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The frustration with learning can be greatly alleviated if we apply the principles and processes offered in this book. If you are a parent, teacher or have ever been a young frustrated learner, you will love this book....&lt;/p&gt;
-Judith DeLozier, Co-author of&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;NLP II: The Next Generation&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a remarkably practical and engaging way, Sid Jacobson offers helpful and unique suggestions for how to help kids to fall in love with learning to learn. It is clear that Sid is sharing a passion that he has developed for many years. I highly recommend this book!&lt;/p&gt;
-Stephen Gilligan, Ph.D., Psychologist,&lt;/br&gt;
author of &lt;i&gt;The Courage To Love&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
