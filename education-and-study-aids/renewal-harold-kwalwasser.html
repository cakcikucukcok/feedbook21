  <title>Renewal - Harold Kwalwasser</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Harold Kwalwasser has put together a call to action for education reform that makes a clear case for what has to be done in order to educate all children to their full potential. He visited forty high-performing and transforming school districts, charters, parochial, and private schools to understand why they have succeeded where others have failed. The analysis in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Renewal: Remaking America&amp;#39;s Schools for the Twenty-First Century&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; brings together all of the necessary changes in one dynamic strategy. Many schools, even though facing seemingly impossible odds, have succeeded brilliantly. But their histories also reflect that there are neither silver bullets or demons. The heart of successful reform is systemic change, which requires the patience, understanding, and commitment of every adult who has a role in the process, from parents and taxpayers, to the school board members, superintendents, and teachers, and on to state legislators and members of Congress.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Renewal &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;offers a clear picture of how to move away from the mass-production style of education that most schools offered throughout the twentieth century to a new, more innovative, and flexible model that can meet this country&amp;#39;s promise of truly educating every child and preparing each of them for the challenges ahead. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
