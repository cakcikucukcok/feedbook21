  <title>Opening Doors - Nga-Wing Anjela Wong</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;In 2014—for the first time—over 50% of those in U.S. public schools are students of color. Furthermore, children of immigrants, the majority of whom are of Asian and Latinx origin, are the fastest-growing population in the U.S. Addressing their needs has become an important issue facing educators, researchers, and policy makers nationwide. More importantly, working-poor and low-income immigrant families of color need support and resources to negotiate and navigate between their home/community and their school/dominant society. Opening Doors: Community Centers Connecting Working-Class Immigrant Families and Schools examines the role and impact of a community-based organization (the Harborview Chinatown Community Center) and its youth program (the Community Youth Center), which is located in an East Coast city. Framed by the &quot;Community Cultural Wealth&quot; framework (Yosso, 2005) and Youth (Comm)Unity, Opening Doors argues that the Harborview Chinatown Community Center helps low-income Chinese immigrant families negotiate and navigate their multiple worlds. Specifically, this book examines the services and support for low-income and working-poor Chinese American immigrant families during out-of-school hours.&lt;/P&gt;" />

Furthermore, children of immigrants, the majority of whom are of Asian and Latinx origin, are the fastest-growing population in the U.S. Addressing their needs has become an important issue facing educators, researchers, and policy makers nationwide. More importantly, working-poor and low-income immigrant families of color need support and resources to negotiate and navigate between their home/community and their school/dominant society. Opening Doors: Community Centers Connecting Working-Class Immigrant Families and Schools examines the role and impact of a community-based organization (the Harborview Chinatown Community Center) and its youth program (the Community Youth Center), which is located in an East Coast city. Framed by the "Community Cultural Wealth" framework (Yosso, 2005) and Youth (Comm)Unity, Opening Doors argues that the Harborview Chinatown Community Center helps low-income Chinese immigrant families negotiate and navigate their multiple worlds.
