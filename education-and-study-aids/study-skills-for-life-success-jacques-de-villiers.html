  <title>Study Skills for Life Success - Jacques De Villiers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Learners who attempt tertiary studies are often not equipped for the study challenges facing them at that level. School leavers behavioral patterns are, however, so well established that efforts to teach them how to study once they start with their tertiary studies are often fruitless. 
This program requires the active input of a facilitator, who might be a teacher, a parent, or anybody with an interest in the development of a child. If you are not prepared to spend time preparing or building relationships, then this program is not for you. 
Please be aware that this program aims to teach principles and not tricks. I was also not trying to promote any specific learning philosophy or approach. I do believe, though, that any child who masters the principles taught in this program will be a better student and a better person who will remain teachable through life." />
