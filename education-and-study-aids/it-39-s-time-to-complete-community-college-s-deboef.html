  <title>It&#39;s Time to Complete Community College - S. deBoef</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Earning a college degree improves health and economic wellbeing. Thus, American taxpayers subsidize a majority of the cost of public colleges. At least half of all college students in the U.S. today attend two-year colleges; yet, fewer than half of these students achieve their educational goals. This book, written by an experienced community college teacher summarizes specific evidence-based methods to improve student learning and completion. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This book summarizes:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul style=&quot;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;student characteristics including socio-economic status, academic background, work/family commitments;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;instructional methods of work-pace, grading procedures, student practice opportunities, and feedback to students;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;institutional policies such as course scheduling, teaching loads, teacher training, availability of student services, commitment of administrators to using assessment to improve student learning outcomes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you are a college student/parent of a college student, college teacher/administrator, or concerned taxpayer; you are invited to read this book and join this discussion. It is unlikely that college completion rates will significantly improve without informed communities demanding institutional action.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
