  <title>The Unintended Consequences of High-Stakes Testing - Gail M. Jones, Brett D. Jones, Tracy Hargrove</title>
      <meta name="description" content="To better understand how high-stakes accountability has influenced teaching and learning, this book takes an in-depth look at the myriad consequences that high-stakes tests hold for students, teachers, administrators, and the public. By focusing on these tests and spending large amounts of time on test preparation and driving teachers to teach low-level, rote memorization, schools are essentially wiping out non-tested subjects such as science, social studies, physical education, and the arts. Although testing is promoted as a strategy for improving education for all, research shows that testing has differential effects on students with special needs, minority students, students living in poverty, and those for whom English is a second language. &lt;i&gt;The Unintended Consequences of High Stakes Testing&lt;/i&gt; unpacks the assumptions and philosophical foundations on which testing policies are based. The authors&#39; arguments are grounded in extensive interviews and research. Through an examination of research, these authors show that high-stakes testing promotes students&#39; dependence on extrinsic motivation at the cost of intrinsic motivation and the associated love of learning-which has tangible impacts on their education and lives." />
