  <title>Summary: The Deviant&#39;s Advantage - BusinessNews Publishing</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;The must-read summary of Ryan Matthews and Watts Wacker&#39;s book: &quot;The Deviant&#39;s Advantage: How Fringe Ideas Create Mass Markets&quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;This complete summary of the ideas from Ryan Matthews and Watts Wacker&#39;s book &quot;The Deviant&#39;s Advantage&quot; shows how today&#39;s most commercially successful products began as fringe ideas that became accepted in the mainstream market. Given the speed at which today’s markets are moving, it’s far more profitable to try and mine for new ideas rather than identify trends already here. In their book, the authors provide a toolkit for harnessing business deviance, by reinventing your organisational structure and making customers your advertising billboard. This summary will teach you to think of your company as a group of core competencies that you can discover and exploit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Added-value of this summary:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;• Save time&lt;br&gt;• Understand key concepts&lt;br&gt;• Expand your business knowledge&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;To learn more, read &quot;The Deviant&#39;s Advantage&quot; and discover why you should deviate from current trends and find the next big thing before everyone else.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
