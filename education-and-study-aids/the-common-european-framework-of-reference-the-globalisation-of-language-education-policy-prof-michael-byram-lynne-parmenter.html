  <title>The Common European Framework of Reference: The Globalisation of Language Education Policy - Prof. Michael Byram, Lynne Parmenter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Common European Framework of Reference for Languages was published a decade ago and has been influential ever since, not only in its European &#39;home&#39; but throughout the world. This book traces the processes of the influence by inviting authors from universities and ministries in 11 countries to describe and explain what happened in their case. There are everyday factors of curriculum development - which sometimes include coincidence and happenstance - and there are also traditions of resistance or acceptance of external influences in policy-making. Such factors have always existed in bilateral borrowing from one country to another but the CEFR is a supra-national document accessible through globalised communication. The book is thus not only focused on matters of language education but is also a Comparative Education case-study of policy borrowing under new conditions." />
